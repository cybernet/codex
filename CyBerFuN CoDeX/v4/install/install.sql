Reactor 4 (image center). Turbine building (image lower left). Reactor 3 (center right)\r\n\r\nThe Chernobyl disaster was a nuclear reactor accident in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in the Soviet Union. It was the worst nuclear power plant disaster ever and the only level 7 instance on the International Nuclear Event Scale. It resulted in a severe release of radioactivity into the environment following a massive power excursion which destroyed the reactor. Two people died in the initial steam explosion, but most deaths from the accident were attributed to nuclear fallout.\r\n\r\nOn 26 April 1986 at 01:23:45 a.m. (UTC+3) reactor number four at the Chernobyl plant, near Pripyat in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, exploded. Further explosions and the resulting fire sent a plume of highly radioactive fallout into the atmosphere and over an extensive geographical area. Four hundred times more fallout was released than had been by the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.\r\n\r\nThe plume drifted over extensive parts of the western Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, Northern Europe, and eastern North America. Large areas in Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia were badly contaminated, resulting in the evacuation and resettlement of over 336,000 people. According to official post-Soviet data, about 60% of the radioactive fallout landed in Belarus.\r\n\r\nThe accident raised concerns about the safety of the Soviet nuclear power industry, slowing its expansion for a number of years, while forcing the Soviet government to become less secretive. The now-independent countries of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus have been burdened with the continuing and substantial decontamination and health care costs of the Chernobyl accident. It is difficult to accurately tell the number of deaths caused by the events at Chernobyl, as the Soviet-era cover-up made it difficult to track down victims. Lists were incomplete, and Soviet authorities later forbade doctors to cite "radiation" on death certificates.\r\n\r\nThe overall cost of the disaster is estimated at $200 billion USD, taking inflation into account. This places the Chernobyl disaster as the costliest disaster in modern history.[unreliable source?]\r\n\r\nThe 2005 report prepared by the Chernobyl Forum, led by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and World Health Organization (WHO), attributed 56 direct deaths (47 accident workers, and nine children with thyroid cancer), and estimated that there may be 4,000 extra cancer deaths among the approximately 600,000 most highly exposed people.Although the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and certain limited areas remain off limits, the majority of affected areas are now considered safe for settlement and economic activity.\r\nThe abandoned city of Pripyat with Chernobyl in the distance\r\nRadio-operated bulldozers being tested prior to use\r\nAbandoned housing blocks in Pripyat\r\nContents\r\n\r\n\r\n    * 1 The Chernobyl nuclear power plant\r\n    * 2 The accident\r\n          o 2.1 Planning the test of the safety device\r\n          o 2.2 Conditions prior to the accident\r\n          o 2.3 Fatal experiment\r\n          o 2.4 Immediate crisis management\r\n                + 2.4.1 Radiation levels\r\n                + 2.4.2 Fire containment\r\n                + 2.4.3 Evacuation of Pripyat\r\n                + 2.4.4 Steam explosion risk\r\n                + 2.4.5 Debris removal\r\n    * 3 Causes of the disaster\r\n    * 4 The effects of the disaster\r\n          o 4.1 International spread of radioactivity\r\n          o 4.2 Radioactive release (source term)\r\n          o 4.3 Health of plant workers\r\n          o 4.4 Residual radioactivity in the environment\r\n                + 4.4.1 Rivers, lakes and reservoirs\r\n                + 4.4.2 Groundwater\r\n                + 4.4.3 Flora and fauna\r\n    * 5 Chernobyl after the disaster\r\n          o 5.1 Chernobyl today\r\n                + 5.1.1 The lava (or FCM- Fuel Containing Materials )\r\n                + 5.1.2 Degradation of the lava\r\n          o 5.2 Possible consequences of further collapse of the Sarcophagus\r\n          o 5.3 Grass and forest fires\r\n    * 6 Recovery process\r\n    * 7 Assessing the disaster''s effects on human health\r\n    * 8 In the popular consciousness\r\n    * 9 Commemoration of the disaster\r\n          o 9.1 Chernobyl 20\r\n    * 10 Representations in games\r\n    * 11 See also\r\n    * 12 Further reading\r\n    * 13 References\r\n    * 14 External links\r\n\r\n[edit] The Chernobyl nuclear power plant\r\nLocation of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant\r\n\r\n    Main article: Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant\r\n\r\nThe Chernobyl station ( [show location on an interactive map] 51?23&#8242;14&#8243;N 30?06&#8242;41&#8243;E&#65279; / &#65279;51.38722?N 30.11139?E&#65279; / 51.38722; 30.11139) is near the town of Pripyat, Ukraine, 18 km (11 mi) northwest of the city of Chernobyl, 16 km (10 mi) from the border of Ukraine and Belarus, and about 110 km (68 mi) north of Kiev. The station consisted of four RBMK-1000 nuclear reactors, each capable of producing 1 gigawatt (GW) of electric power, and the four together produced about 10% of Ukraine''s electricity at the time of the accident. Construction of the plant began in the late 1970s, with reactor no. 1 commissioned in 1977, followed by no. 2 (1978), no. 3 (1981), and no. 4 (1983). Two more reactors, no. 5 and 6, also capable of producing 1 GW each, were under construction at the time of the accident.\r\n\r\n The accident\r\n\r\nOn 26 April 1986 at 1:23:45 a.m., reactor 4 suffered a massive, catastrophic power excursion, resulting in a steam explosion, which tore the top from the reactor, exposed the core, and dispersed large amounts of radioactive particulate and gaseous debris (mostly Cesium-137 and Strontium-90), allowing air (oxygen) to contact the super-hot core containing 1,700 tonnes of combustible graphite moderator; the burning graphite moderator increased the emission of radioactive particles. The radioactivity was not contained by any kind of containment vessel (unlike most Western plants; Soviet reactors often did not have them). Radioactive particles were carried by wind across international borders.\r\n\r\n[edit] Planning the test of the safety device\r\n\r\nDuring the daytime of 25 April 1986, reactor 4 ( [show location on an interactive map] 51?23&#8242;22&#8243;N 30?05&#8242;56&#8243;E&#65279; / &#65279;51.38944?N 30.09889?E&#65279; / 51.38944; 30.09889) was scheduled to be shut down for maintenance as it was near the end of its first fuel cycle. An experiment was proposed to test a safety emergency core cooling feature during the shut down procedure.\r\n\r\nA very large amount of cooling water is needed to maintain a safe temperature in the reactor core. The reactor consisted of about 1,600 individual fuel channels and each operational channel requires a flow of 28 tonnes of water per hour. There was concern that in case of an external power failure the Chernobyl power station would overload, leading to an automated safety shut down in which case there would be no external power to run the plant''s cooling water pumps. Chernobyl''s reactors had three backup diesel generators. The generator required 15 seconds to start up but took 60-75 seconds to attain full speed and reach its capacity of 5.5 MW required to run one main cooling water pump.\r\nA rotor of a modern day steam turbine\r\n\r\nThis one-minute power gap was considered unacceptable and it was suggested that the mechanical energy (rotational momentum) of the steam turbine could be used to generate electricity to run the main cooling water pumps, due to it spinning down. Because generator voltage varies with its rotational speed, a special device is required to provide stable voltage to the main cooling pumps as the turbine spins down. This safety device?a voltage regulating system?was to be tested during a simulated power "blackout". In theory, it should have been able to provide power for 45 seconds and thus bridge the power gap between the onset of the external power failure and the full availability of electric power from the diesel emergency generators.\r\n\r\nThe reactor was designed such that it needed coolant even when not actively operating. In case of an external power failure, the reactor would automatically scram; control rods would be inserted and stop the nuclear fission process (and hence steam generation). However, in the spent fuel, the fission products themselves were highly radioactive, and continued to produce heat as they decayed. This could amount to 1-2 percent of the normal output of the plant. If not immediately removed by coolant systems, the heat could lead to core damage.\r\n\r\nThe amount of spent fuel, and thus the amount of decay heat that the cooling system must handle, increased throughout operation and attained its maximum value at the end of the fuel cycle. In the event of core damage, the end of the fuel cycle would present the worst possible point in time, with the maximum accumulated inventory of nuclides to be released into the environment. The experiment would have been far safer to carry out with fresh fuel. This means that the simulated power blackout experiment was performed at the most dangerous point in the reactor cycle.\r\n\r\nIt was a design requirement that the rotational momentum of the steam turbine, as it spun down, could be used to generate electricity to run the cooling water pumps to bridge the power gap. A previous test had been unsuccessful. Apparently, the test had not been completed successfully by March 1984 when the unit was brought into commercial operation ahead of schedule and celebrated as a "labour victory". Under pressure, the director of the Chernobyl station Viktor Bryukhanov signed an acceptance document on the last day of 1983, in order to declare that works planned for that year had been fulfilled. Had he not done so, thousands of workers, engineers and his own superiors would have lost bonuses, awards and other extras. Records were falsified to hide this fact.\r\n\r\nThe Chernobyl power plant had been in operation for two years without this important safety feature. The station managers must have wished to correct this at the first opportunity. This could explain why they were so determined to carry out the test, even when serious problems arose, and why the requisite approval for the test was not sought from the Soviet nuclear oversight regulatory body.\r\n\r\nFor the experiment, the reactor would be set at a low power setting and the steam turbine run up to full speed, at which point the steam supply would be closed off and the turbines allowed to freewheel, as the results were recorded.\r\n\r\n[edit] Conditions prior to the accident\r\n\r\nConditions to run the test were prepared during the daytime of 25 April 1986. The day shift had been instructed in advance about the test and was familiar with procedures. A special team of electrical engineers was present to test the new voltage regulating system. As planned, the reactor''s power output had been gradually reduced to 50%. Then a regional power station unexpectedly went offline. The Kiev grid controller requested that the further reduction of output be postponed, as power was consequently needed to satisfy the evening peak demand. The Chernobyl plant director agreed and postponed the test to comply.\r\n\r\nAt 11:04 p.m., the Kiev grid controller allowed the reactor shut-down to resume. This delay had serious consequences: the day shift had long since departed, the evening shift was also preparing to leave, and the night shift wouldn''t take over until 12:00 a.m., well into the experiment. The special team of electrical engineers must have been exhausted from the long wait; according to plan, the test should have been finalized during the daytime and the night shift would only have to maintain basic cooling systems in a plant otherwise shut down, though the night shift was not prepared to carry out the experiment. Alexander Akimov was chief of the night shift and Leonid Toptunov was the operator responsible for the reactor''s operational regime, including the movement of the control rods. Toptunov was a young engineer who had only worked independently as a senior engineer for about three months.\r\n\r\nIn Valeri Legasov''s posthumous article, he maintains that the operators did not know what the test was about:\r\n\r\n    I have in my safe a transcript of the operators'' telephone conversations on the eve of the accident. Reading the transcript makes one''s flesh creep. One operator rings another and asks: What shall I do? In the programme there are instructions of what to do, and then a lot of things are crossed out. His interlocutor thought for a while and then replied: Follow the crossed out instructions.\r\n\r\nThe test plan called for the power output of reactor 4 to be reduced from its nominal 3200 MW thermal to 700?1000 MW thermal. For unknown reasons, Toptunov committed an error and inserted the control rods too far, causing the reactor to a near shut down. The exact circumstances will probably never be known as both Akimov and Toptunov died from radiation sickness.\r\n\r\nThe reactor power dropped to 30 MW thermal (10 MW electrical) ? almost complete shut down level and approximately 5 percent of what was expected. At this low power output a phenomenon called xenon poisoning, by which high levels of xenon-135 absorb neutrons and thus inhibit nuclear reaction, became predominant.\r\n\r\nAt this low power output it was impossible to carry out the test. The operators seem to have been unaware of the xenon poisoning, perhaps believing that the rapid fall in output was due to a malfunction in one of the automatic power regulators. To increase power, control rods were pulled out of the reactor core, beyond the correct position for normal operations, and also beyond what is allowed under safety regulations. To do this, staff had to use manual controls to override the automatic system.\r\n\r\nSlowly, the reactor''s power only increased to 200 MW, less than a third of the minimum required for the experiment, yet the experiment was continued. As part of the test plan, at 1:05 a.m. on 26 April extra water pumps were activated, increasing the water flow. The flow exceeded the safe limit at 1:19 a.m. The extra water lowered the core temperature and reduced steam voids. However, since water also absorbs neutrons (and the higher density of liquid water makes it a better absorber than steam), this decreased reactor power further. This prompted the operators to remove the manual control rods.\r\n\r\nThis produced an extremely unstable condition with nearly all of the control rods removed; a setup for a run-away reaction. The only thing holding the reactor at such a low power level was the high levels of neutron-absorbing xenon. The increased water flow led to a fall in steam production and other changes in the operating parameters. At this point the automatic control system should have shut the reactor down. To avoid this, the operators had disabled the shut down system.\r\n\r\n[edit] Fatal experiment\r\nAerial view of the damaged core. Roof of the turbine hall is damaged (image center). Roof of the adjacent reactor 3 (image lower left) shows minor fire damage.\r\n\r\nAt 1:23:04 a.m. the experiment began. The extremely unstable condition of the reactor was not known to the reactor crew, and the steam to the turbines was shut off. As the momentum of the turbine generator drove the water pumps, the water flow rate decreased, leading to the formation of steam voids. The control rods that were removed earlier were never fully removed and were still partially in the reactor, preventing the heat from reaching the cooling water. The great rise in temperature resulted in a massive steam build up and, due to the fact that the RBMK type reactors are largely positive void coefficient, the power within the reactor only increased. As the reactor power increased, so did the neutron generation. Soon it exceeded what could be absorbed by the xenon poisoning, starting a dangerous cascade. With the manual and automatic neutron absorbing control rods removed, nothing prevented a runaway reaction.\r\n\r\nWith reactor output rapidly increasing, the operators pressed the AZ-5 ("Rapid Emergency Defense 5") button at 1:23:40, which ordered a "SCRAM" ? a shutdown of the reactor, fully inserting all control rods, including the manual control rods that had been incautiously withdrawn earlier. It is unclear whether it was done as an emergency measure, or simply as a routine method of shutting down the reactor upon the completion of an experiment (the reactor was scheduled to be shut down for routine maintenance). The SCRAM may have been ordered as a response to the unexpected rapid power increase; on the other hand, Dyatlov writes in his book:\r\n\r\n    Prior to 01:23:40, systems of centralized control ? didn''t register any parameter changes that could justify the SCRAM. Commission ? gathered and analyzed large amount of materials and, as stated in its report, failed to determine the reason why the SCRAM was ordered. There was no need to look for the reason. The reactor was simply being shut down upon the completion of the experiment.\r\n\r\nThe control rod insertion mechanism operated at relatively slow speed (0.4 m/s) taking 18?20 seconds to travel the full approximately 7 meter core-length (height). A bigger problem was a flawed graphite-tip control rod design, which initially displaced coolant, before the reaction was slowed. In this way, the SCRAM actually increased the reaction rate. At this point a massive energy spike occurred, and the core overheated. Some of the fuel rods fractured, blocking the control rod columns, and causing the control rods to become stuck after being inserted only one-third of the way. Within three seconds the reactor output rose above 530 MW. By 1:23:47 (seven seconds after the AZ-5 button was pressed) the reactor jumped to around 30 GW thermal, ten times the normal operational output. The rapid increase in steam pressure destroyed fuel channels and ruptured the large diameter cooling water pipes. Fuel rods began to melt and reached the cooling water in the flooded basement.\r\n\r\nAt 1:24, 20 seconds after the SCRAM was ordered, the first steam explosion took place. It blew the 2,000 ton lid off of the reactor, damaged the top of the reactor hall, and ejected fragments of material. This ruptured further fuel channels, lifted control rods and sheared off horizontal pipes. A second, more powerful explosion occurred about two or three seconds after the first:\r\nLumps of graphite moderator ejected from the core. The largest lump shows an intact control rod channel.\r\n\r\n    The second explosion was caused by the hydrogen which had been produced either by the overheated steam-zirconium reaction or by the reaction of red-hot graphite with steam that produce hydrogen and oxygen. According to observers outside Unit 4, burning lumps of material and sparks shot into the air above the reactor. Some of them fell onto the roof of the machine hall and started a fire. About 25 per cent of the red-hot graphite blocks and overheated material from the fuel channels was ejected. ... Parts of the graphite blocks and fuel channels were blown out of the reactor building. ... As a result of the damage to the building an airflow through the core was established by the high temperature of the core. The air ignited the hot graphite and started a graphite fire.\r\n\r\nThe graphite fire greatly contributed to the spread of radioactive material and the contamination of outlying areas.\r\n\r\nContrary to safety regulations, a combustible material (bitumen) had been used in the construction of the roof of the reactor building and the turbine hall. Ejected material had ignited at least five fires on the roof of the (still operating) adjacent reactor 3. It was imperative to put those fires out and protect the cooling systems of reactor 3. Inside reactor 3, the chief of the night shift, Yuri Bagdasarov, wanted to shut down the reactor immediately, but chief engineer Fomin would not allow this. The operators were given respirators and potassium iodide tablets and told to continue working. At 05:00, however, Bagdasarov made his own decision to stop the reactor, leaving only those operators there who had to work the emergency cooling systems.\r\n\r\n[edit] Immediate crisis management\r\n\r\n[edit] Radiation levels\r\n\r\nThe radiation levels in the worst-hit areas of the reactor building have been estimated to be 5.6 r?ntgen per second (R/s) (0.056 Grays per second, or Gy/s), which is equivalent to 20,000 r?ntgen per hour (R/hr) (200 Gy per hour, or Gy/hr). A lethal dose is around 500 r?ntgen (5 Gy) over 5 hours, so in some areas, unprotected workers received fatal doses within several minutes. However, a dosimeter capable of measuring up to 1,000 R/s (10 Gy/s) was inaccessible due to the explosion, and another one failed when turned on. All remaining dosimeters had limits of 0.001 R/s (0.00001 Gy/s) and therefore read "off scale". Thus, the reactor crew could ascertain only that the radiation levels were somewhere above 0.001 R/s (3.6 R/hr, or 0.036 Gy/hr), while the true levels were much higher in some areas.\r\n\r\nBecause of the inaccurate low readings, the reactor crew chief Alexander Akimov assumed that the reactor was intact. The evidence of pieces of graphite and reactor fuel lying around the building was ignored, and the readings of another dosimeter brought in by 4:30 a.m. were dismissed under the assumption that the new dosimeter must have been defective. Akimov stayed with his crew in the reactor building until morning, trying to pump water into the reactor. None of them wore any protective gear. Most of them, including Akimov, died from radiation exposure within three weeks.[citation needed]\r\n\r\n Fire containment\r\nFirefighter Leonid Telyatnikov, being decorated for bravery\r\n\r\nShortly after the accident, firefighters arrived to try to extinguish the fires. The first one to the scene was a Chernobyl Power Station firefighter brigade under the command of Lieutenant Vladimir Pravik, who died on 9 May 1986 of acute radiation sickness. They were not told how dangerously radioactive the smoke and the debris were, and may not even have known that the accident was anything more than a regular electrical fire: "We didn''t know it was the reactor. No one had told us."\r\n\r\nGrigorii Khmel, the driver of one of the fire-engines, later described what happened:\r\n\r\n    We arrived there at 10 or 15 minutes to two in the morning ... We saw graphite scattered about. Misha asked: What is graphite? I kicked it away. But one of the fighters on the other truck picked it up. It''s hot, he said. The pieces of graphite were of different sizes, some big, some small enough to pick up ...\r\n    We didn''t know much about radiation. Even those who worked there had no idea. There was no water left in the trucks. Misha filled the cistern and we aimed the water at the top. Then those boys who died went up to the roof - Vashchik Kolya and others, and Volodya Pravik ... They went up the ladder ... and I never saw them again.\r\n\r\nThe immediate priority was to extinguish fires on the roof of the station and the area around the building containing Reactor No. 4 in order to protect No. 3 and keep its core cooling systems intact. The fires were extinguished by 5 a.m., but many firefighters received high doses of radiation. The fire inside Reactor No. 4 continued to burn until 10 May 1986; it is possible that well over half of the graphite burned out. The fire was extinguished by a combined effort of helicopters dropping over 5,000 tonnes of materials like sand, lead, clay and boron onto the burning reactor and injection of liquid nitrogen. Ukranian filmmaker Vladimir Shevchenko captured film footage of a Mi-8 helicopter as it lost its bearings while dropping its load and got its rotors tangled in the gibbets of a nearby construction crane, causing the wrecked copter to fall into the damaged reactor building and kill its two-man crew.\r\n\r\nFrom eyewitness accounts of the firefighters involved before they died (as reported on the CBC television series Witness), one described his experience of the radiation as "tasting like metal", and feeling a sensation similar to that of pins and needles all over his face. (This is similar to the description given by Louis Slotin, a Manhattan Project physicist who died days after a fatal radiation overdose from a criticality accident.)\r\n\r\nThe explosion and fire threw particles of the nuclear fuel and also far more dangerous radioactive elements like caesium-137, iodine-131, strontium-90 and other radionuclides into the air: the residents of the surrounding area observed the radioactive cloud on the night of the explosion.\r\n\r\nEvacuation of Pripyat\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter radiation levels set off alarms at the Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant in Sweden, the Soviet Union did admit that an accident had occurred, but still tried to cover up the scale of the disaster. In order to evacuate the city of Pripyat, the following warning message was reported on local radio, "An accident has occurred at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. One of the atomic reactors has been damaged. Aid will be given to those affected and a committee of government inquiry has been set up." This message gave the impression that any damage and radiation was localized, although it was not.\r\n\r\nThe government committee formed to investigate the accident, led by Valeri Legasov, arrived at Chernobyl in the evening of 26 April. By that time two people were dead and 52 were hospitalized. During the night of 26 April / 27 April ? more than 24 hours after the explosion ? the committee, faced with ample evidence of extremely high levels of radiation and a number of cases of radiation exposure, had to acknowledge the destruction of the reactor and order the evacuation of the nearby city of Pripyat.\r\n\r\nThe evacuation began at 14:00, 27 April. In order to reduce baggage the residents were told that the evacuation would be temporary, lasting approximately three days. As a result, Pripyat still contains personal belongings.\r\n\r\n Steam explosion risk\r\nLava flows formed by fuel-containing mass in the basement of the plant. Lava flow (1). Concrete (2). Steam pipe (3). Electrical equipment (4)\r\n\r\nThere was a bubbler pool beneath the reactor. It served as a large water reservoir from the emergency cooling pumps and as a pressure suppression system capable of condensing steam from a (small) broken steam pipe. The pool and the basement were flooded due to ruptured cooling water pipes and accumulated fire water. It now constituted a serious steam explosion risk. The smouldering fuel and other material above were starting to burn their way through the reactor floor, mixing with molten concrete that had lined the reactor, and creating a radioactive semi-liquid material comparable to lava. If this mixture had melted through the floor into the pool of water, it would create a massive steam explosion which would eject more radioactive material from the reactor. It became an immediate priority to drain the pool.\r\n\r\nThe bubbler pool could be drained by opening its sluice gates. Volunteers in diving suits entered the radioactive water and managed to open the gates. These were engineers Alexei Ananenko (who knew where the valves were) and Valeri Bezpalov, accompanied by a third man, Boris Baranov, who provided them with light from a lamp, though this lamp failed, leaving them to find the valves by feeling their way along a pipe. None of the three ever returned to the surface and it is thought one of them died before reaching the gates. Fire brigade pumps were then used to drain the basement. The operation was only completed by 8 May, after having pumped out 20,000 tonnes of highly radioactive water.\r\n\r\nWith the bubbler pool gone, a meltdown was less likely to produce a powerful steam explosion. The molten core would now have to reach the water table below the reactor. To reduce the likelihood of this it was decided to freeze the earth beneath the reactor; this would also stabilize the foundations. Using oil drilling equipment, injection of liquid nitrogen began on 4 May. It was estimated that 25 tonnes of liquid nitrogen per day would be required to keep the soil frozen at -100 ?C.[34]\r\n\r\n Debris removal\r\n\r\nThe worst of the radioactive debris was collected inside what was left of the reactor, much of it shoveled in by liquidators wearing heavy protective gear (dubbed "bio-robots" by the military); these workers could only spend a maximum of 40 seconds at a time working on the rooftops of the surrounding buildings due to the extremely high doses of radiation given off by the blocks of graphite and other debris. The reactor itself was covered with bags containing sand, lead and boric acid thrown off helicopters (some 5,000 metric tonnes during the week following the accident). By December 1986 a large concrete sarcophagus had been erected, to seal off the reactor and its contents.\r\n\r\nMany of the vehicles used by the "liquidators" remain parked in a field in the Chernobyl area to this day, most giving off doses of 10-30 R/hr (0.1-0.3 Gy/hr) over 20 years after the disaster.\r\n\r\nCauses of the disaster\r\n\r\nThere were two official explanations of the accident: the first, ''flawed operators explanation'', was published in August 1986 and effectively placed the blame on the power plant operators. There is no question that the operators violated the reactor''s design specifications, and were seemingly ignorant of the safety requirements needed by the RBMK design. This was probably due to their lack of knowledge of reactor physics and engineering, as well as lack of experience and training. At the time of the accident, the reactor was being operated with many key safety systems shut off, most notably the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS).\r\n\r\nIn his book, "The Truth about Chernobyl," Grigori Medvedev (who was Deputy Director of the main industrial department in the Ministry of Energy that oversaw the construction of nuclear power plants at the time of the accident, and who also had been Deputy Chief Engineer for the Chernobyl No. 1 reactor in the 1970s) lists seven different serious violations of the reactor''s operational safety specifications that were committed during the preparation and conduct of the fateful test. He blames the chief engineer of the Chernobyl No. 4 reactor, N.M. Fomin, saying "...only a man with no understanding of the processes of neutron physics inside a nuclear reactor could possibly have switched off the emergency core cooling system, which could in the critical seconds have prevented the blast by sharply reducing steam content in the core."\r\n\r\nSeveral procedural irregularities also helped to make the accident possible. One was insufficient communication between the safety officers and the operators in charge of the experiment being run that night. The reactor operators disabled every safety system down to the generators, which the test was really about. The main process computer, SKALA, was running in such a way that the main control computer could not shut down the reactor or even reduce power. Normally the reactor would have started to insert all of the control rods. The computer would have also started the "Emergency Core Protection System" that introduces 24 control rods into the active zone within 2.5 seconds, which is still slow by 1986 standards. All control was transferred from the process computer to the human operators.\r\n\r\nThe second ''flawed design explanation'' was discussed by Valeri Legasov and published in 1991, attributing the accident to flaws in the RBMK reactor design, specifically the control rods.\r\n\r\n    * The reactor had a dangerously large positive void coefficient. The void coefficient is a measurement of how the reactor responds to increased steam formation in the water coolant. Most other reactor designs produce less energy as they get hotter, because if the coolant contains steam bubbles, fewer neutrons are slowed down. Faster neutrons are less likely to split uranium atoms, so the reactor produces less power. Chernobyl''s RBMK reactor, however, used solid graphite as a neutron moderator to slow down the neutrons, and neutron-absorbing light water to cool the core. Thus neutrons are slowed down even if steam bubbles form in the water. Furthermore, because steam absorbs neutrons much less readily than water, increasing an RBMK reactor''s temperature means that more neutrons are able to split uranium atoms, increasing the reactor''s power output. This makes the RBMK design very unstable at low power levels, and prone to suddenly increasing energy production to dangerous level if the temperature rises. This was counter-intuitive and unknown to the crew.\r\n    * A more significant flaw was in the design of the control rods that are inserted into the reactor to slow down the reaction. In the RBMK reactor design, the control rod end tips were made of graphite and the extenders (the end areas of the control rods above the end tips, measuring 1-metre (3 ft) in length) were hollow and filled with water, while the rest of the rod ? the truly functional part which absorbs the neutrons and thereby halts the reaction ? was made of boron carbide. With this design, when the rods are initially inserted into the reactor, the graphite ends displace some coolant. This greatly increases the rate of the fission reaction, since graphite is a more potent neutron moderator (a material that enables a nuclear reaction) and also absorbs far fewer neutrons than the boiling light water. Thus for the first few seconds of control rod activation, reactor power output is increased, rather than reduced as desired. This behavior is counter-intuitive and was not known to the reactor operators.\r\n    * The water channels run through the core vertically, meaning that the water''s temperature increases as it moves up and thus creates a temperature gradient in the core. This effect is exacerbated if the top portion turns completely to steam, since the topmost part of the core is no longer being properly cooled and reactivity greatly increases. (By contrast, the CANDU reactor''s water channels run through the core horizontally, with water flowing in opposite directions among adjacent channels. Hence, the core has a much more even temperature distribution.)\r\n    * To reduce costs, and because of its large size, the reactor had been constructed without any secure containment. This allowed the radioactive contaminants to freely escape into the atmosphere after the steam explosion burst the primary pressure vessel.\r\n    * The reactor also had been running for over one year, and was storing fission byproducts; these byproducts pushed the reactor towards disaster.\r\n    * As the reactor heated up, design flaws caused the reactor vessel to warp and break up, making further insertion of control rods impossible as the heat deformed them.\r\n\r\nBoth commissions were heavily lobbied by different groups, including the reactor''s designers, power plant personnel, and by the Soviet and Ukrainian governments. The IAEA''s 1986 analysis attributed the main cause of the accident to the operators'' actions. But in January 1993, the IAEA issued a revised analysis, attributing the main cause to the reactor''s design.\r\n\r\nAnother contributing factor was that the operators were not informed about problems with the reactor. According to Anatoliy Dyatlov, the designers knew that the reactor was dangerous in some conditions but intentionally concealed this information.[citation needed] In addition, the plant''s management was largely composed of non-RBMK-qualified personnel: the director, V.P. Bryukhanov, had experience and training in a coal-fired power plant. His chief engineer, Nikolai Fomin, also came from a conventional power plant. Dyatlov, deputy chief engineer of reactors 3 and 4, had only "some experience with small nuclear reactors", namely smaller versions of the VVER nuclear reactors that were designed for the Soviet Navy''s nuclear submarines.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nMany or all of these factors probably contributed to the disaster. A potentially unstable reactor design, shoddy and inadequate safety features, poorly-trained or incompetent operators, and a lack of containment building all worked together on that horrific April night in the Byelorussian-Ukrainian Woodlands. The underlying vulnerabilities and flaws in the Soviet nuclear industry which set the stage for the tragedy had been developing for as much as 35 years. Grigori Medvedev''s book, "The Truth about Chernobyl" tells how the secretive, authoritarian Soviet bureaucracy (which valued party loyalty over competence) kept promoting incompetent personnel and choosing cheapness over safety until it engineered this terrible catastrophe.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the disaster\r\n\r\n    Main article: Chernobyl disaster effects\r\n\r\n International spread of radioactivity\r\nMoscow''s Mitino cemetery Chernobyl monument\r\n\r\nThe nuclear meltdown produced a radioactive cloud that floated not over just the modern states of Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova, but also Turkish Thrace, the Southern coast of the Black Sea, Macedonia, Serbia, Croatia, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Austria, Hungary, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, The Netherlands, Belgium, Slovenia, Poland, Switzerland, Germany, Luxembourg, Italy, Ireland, France (including Corsica) the United Kingdom and the Isle of Man.\r\n\r\nThe initial evidence that a major exhaust of radioactive material was affecting other countries came not from Soviet sources, but from Sweden, where on 27 April workers at the Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant (approximately 1,100 km (680 mi) from the Chernobyl site) were found to have radioactive particles on their clothes. It was Sweden''s search for the source of radioactivity, after they had determined there was no leak at the Swedish plant, which led to the first hint of a serious nuclear problem in the western Soviet Union. The rise of radiation levels had at that time already been measured in Finland, but a civil service strike delayed the response and publication.\r\n\r\nContamination from the Chernobyl accident was scattered irregularly depending on weather conditions. Reports from Soviet and Western scientists indicate that Belarus received about 60% of the contamination that fell on the former Soviet Union. However, the 2006 TORCH report stated that half of the volatile particles had landed outside Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. A large area in Russia south of Bryansk was also contaminated, as were parts of northwestern Ukraine. Studies in countries around the area say that over one million people could have been affected by radiation.\r\n\r\nIn Western Europe, measures were taken including seemingly arbitrary regulations pertaining to the legality of importation of certain foods but not others. In France some officials stated that the Chernobyl accident had no adverse effects.\r\n\r\nRadioactive release (source term)\r\n\r\nLike many other releases of radioactivity into the environment, the Chernobyl release was controlled by the physical and chemical properties of the radioactive elements in its core. While plutonium is often perceived as particularly dangerous nuclear fuel by the general population, its effects are almost eclipsed by those of its fission products. Particularly dangerous are highly radioactive compounds that accumulate in the food chain, such as some isotopes of iodine and strontium.\r\nThe external gamma dose for a person in the open near the Chernobyl site.\r\nThe contributions by the various isotopes to the dose (in air) in the contaminated area soon after the accident.\r\n\r\nTwo reports on the release of radioisotopes from the site were made available, one by the OSTI, and a more detailed report by OECD, both in 1998. At different times after the accident, different isotopes were responsible for the majority of the external dose. The dose that was calculated is that received from external gamma irradiation for a person standing in the open. The dose to a person in a shelter or the internal dose is harder to estimate.\r\n\r\nThe release of the radioisotopes from the nuclear fuel was largely controlled by their boiling points, and the majority of the radioactivity present in the core was retained in the reactor.\r\n\r\n    * All of the noble gases, including krypton and xenon, contained within the reactor were released immediately into the atmosphere by the first steam explosion.\r\n    * About 55% of the radioactive iodine in the reactor was released, as a mixture of vapor, solid particles and as organic iodine compounds.\r\n    * Caesium and tellurium were released in aerosol form.\r\n\r\nTwo sizes of particles were released: small particles of 0.3 to 1.5 micrometers (aerodynamic diameter) and large particles of 10 micrometers. The large particles contained about 80% to 90% of the released nonvolatile radioisotopes zirconium-95, niobium-95, lanthanum-140, cerium-144 and the transuranic elements, including neptunium, plutonium and the minor actinides, embedded in a uranium oxide matrix.\r\n\r\nHealth of plant workers\r\nA monument in Chisinau, Moldova\r\n\r\nIn the aftermath of the accident, 237 people suffered from acute radiation sickness, of whom 31 died within the first three months. Most of these were fire and rescue workers trying to bring the accident under control, who were not fully aware of how dangerous the radiation exposure (from the smoke) was (for a discussion of the more important isotopes in fallout, see fission product). 135,000 people were evacuated from the area, including 50,000 from Pripyat.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nResidual radioactivity in the environment\r\n\r\nRivers, lakes and reservoirs\r\n\r\nThe Chernobyl nuclear power plant lies next to the Pripyat River which feeds into the Dnieper River reservoir system, one of the largest surface water systems in Europe. The radioactive contamination of aquatic systems therefore became a major issue in the immediate aftermath of the accident. In the most affected areas of Ukraine, levels of radioactivity (particularly radioiodine: I-131, radiocaesium: Cs-137 and radiostrontium: Sr-90) in drinking water caused concern during the weeks and months after the accident. After this initial period however, radioactivity in rivers and reservoirs was generally below guideline limits for safe drinking water.\r\n\r\nBio-accumulation of radioactivity in fish resulted in concentrations (both in western Europe and in the former Soviet Union) that in many cases were significantly above guideline maximum levels for consumption. Guideline maximum levels for radiocaesium in fish vary from country to country but are approximately 1,000 Bq/kg in the European Union. In the Kiev Reservoir in Ukraine, activity concentrations in fish were several thousand Bq/kg during the years after the accident. In small "closed" lakes in Belarus and the Bryansk region of Russia, activity concentrations in a number of fish species varied from 0.1 to 60 kBq/kg during the period 1990?92. The contamination of fish caused concern in the short term (months) for parts of the UK and Germany and in the long term (years-decades) in the Chernobyl affected areas of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia as well as in parts of Scandinavia.\r\n\r\nGroundwater\r\nMap of radiation levels in 1996 around Chernobyl.\r\n\r\nGroundwater was not badly affected by the Chernobyl accident since radionuclides with short half-lives decayed away a long time before they could affect groundwater supplies, and longer-lived radionuclides such as radiocaesium and radiostrontium were absorbed to surface soils before they could transfer to groundwaters.Significant transfers of radionuclides to groundwaters have occurred from waste disposal sites in the 30 km (19 mi) exclusion zone around Chernobyl. Although there is a potential for off-site (i.e. out of the 30 km (19 mi) exclusion zone) transfer of radionuclides from these disposal sites, the IAEA Chernobyl Report  argues that this is not significant in comparison to current levels of washout of surface-deposited radioactivity.\r\n\r\nFlora and fauna\r\n\r\nAfter the disaster, four square kilometres of pine forest in the immediate vicinity of the reactor turned ginger brown and died, earning the name of the "Red Forest". Some animals in the worst-hit areas also died or stopped reproducing. Most domestic animals were evacuated from the exclusion zone, but horses left on an island in the Pripyat River 6 km (4 mi) from the power plant died when their thyroid glands were destroyed by radiation doses of 150?200 Sv. Some cattle on the same island died and those that survived were stunted because of thyroid damage. The next generation appeared to be normal.\r\n\r\nIn the years since the disaster, the exclusion zone abandoned by humans has become a haven for wildlife, with nature reserves declared (Belarus) or proposed (Ukraine) for the area. Many species of wild animals and birds, which were not seen in the area prior to the disaster, are now plentiful due to the absence of humans.\r\n\r\nA robot sent into the reactor itself has returned with samples of black, melanin-rich fungi that are growing on the reactor''s walls.\r\n\r\nChernobyl after the disaster\r\nThe Prypiat Ferris wheel as seen from inside the town''s Palace of Culture.\r\n\r\nFollowing the accident, questions arose about the future of the plant and its eventual fate. All work on the unfinished reactors 5 and 6 was halted three years later. However, the trouble at the Chernobyl plant did not end with the disaster in reactor 4. The damaged reactor was sealed off and 200 metres (660 ft) of concrete was placed between the disaster site and the operational buildings. The Ukrainian government continued to let the three remaining reactors operate because of an energy shortage in the country. A fire broke out in the turbine building of reactor 2 in 1991. the authorities subsequently declared the reactor damaged beyond repair and had it taken offline. Reactor 1 was decommissioned in November 1996 as part of a deal between the Ukrainian government and international organizations such as the IAEA to end operations at the plant. On 15 December 2000, then-President Leonid Kuchma personally turned off Reactor 3 in an official ceremony, effectively shutting down the entire plant transforming the Chernobyl plant from energy producer to energy consumer.\r\n\r\nChernobyl today\r\nMonument in Rivne, Ukraine\r\n\r\nThe Chernobyl reactor is now enclosed in a large concrete sarcophagus which was built quickly to allow continuing operation of the other reactors at the plant. However, the structure is not strong or durable. Some major work on the sarcophagus was carried out in 1998 and 1999. Some 200 tons of highly radioactive material remains deep within it, and this poses an environmental hazard until it is better contained.\r\n\r\nA New Safe Confinement structure will be built by the end of 2011, and then will be put into place on rails. It is to be a metal arch 105 meters high and spanning 257 metres, to cover both unit 4 and the hastily built 1986 structure. The Chernobyl Shelter Fund, set up in 1997, has received ?810 million from international donors and projects to cover this project and previous work. It and the Nuclear Safety Account, also applied to Chernobyl decommissioning, are managed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).[citation needed]\r\n\r\nAs of 2006, some fuel at units 1 to 3 remained in the reactors, most of which is in each unit''s cooling pond, as well as some material in a small interim spent fuel storage facility pond (ISF-1).\r\n\r\nIn 1999 a contract was signed for construction of a radioactive waste management facility to store 25,000 used fuel assemblies from units 1?3 and other operational wastes, as well as material from decommissioning units 1?3 (which will be the first RBMK units decommissioned anywhere). The contract included a processing facility, able to cut the RBMK fuel assemblies and to put the material in canisters, which will be filled with inert gas and welded shut. They will then be transported to the dry storage vaults in which the fuel containers would be enclosed for up to 100 years. This facility, treating 2500 fuel assemblies per year, would be the first of its kind for RBMK fuel. However, after a significant part of the storage structures had been built, technical deficiencies in the concept emerged, and the contract was terminated in 2007. The interim spent fuel storage facility (ISF-2) will now be completed by others by mid 2013.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nAnother contract has been let for a Liquid radioactive Waste Treatment Plant, to handle some 35,000 cubic meters of low- and intermediate-level liquid wastes at the site. This will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on site.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nIn January 2008 the Ukraine government announced a 4-stage decommissioning plan which incorporates the above waste activities and progresses towards a cleared site.\r\n\r\nThe lava (or FCM- Fuel Containing Materials )\r\nThe radioactivity levels of different isotopes in the FCM, as back-calculated by Russian workers to April 1986\r\n\r\nAccording to official estimates, about 95% of the fuel (about 180 tonnes) in the reactor at the time of the accident remains inside the shelter, with a total radioactivity of nearly 18 million curies (670 PBq). The radioactive material consists of core fragments, dust, and lava-like "fuel-containing materials" (FCM) that flowed through the wrecked reactor building before hardening into a ceramic form.\r\n\r\nThree different lavas are present in the basement of the reactor building; black, brown and a porous ceramic. They are silicate glasses with inclusions of other materials present within them. The porous lava is brown lava which had dropped into water thus being cooled rapidly.\r\n\r\nDegradation of the lava\r\n\r\nIt is unclear how long the ceramic form will retard the release of radioactivity. From 1997 to 2002 a series of papers were published which suggested that the self irradiation of the lava would convert all 1,200 tons into a submicrometre and mobile powder within a few weeks. But it has been reported that it is likely that the degradation of the lava is to be a slow and gradual process rather than a sudden rapid process. The same paper states that the loss of uranium from the wrecked reactor is only 10 kg (22 lb) per year. This low rate of uranium leaching suggests that the lava is resisting its environment. The paper also states that when the shelter is improved, the leaching rate of the lava will decrease.\r\n\r\nSome of the surfaces of the lava flows have started to show new uranium minerals such as Na4(UO2)(CO3)3 and uranyl carbonate. However the level of radioactivity is such that during one hundred years the self irradiation of the lava (2 ? 1016 &#945; decays per gram and 2 to 5 ? 105 Gy of &#946; or &#947;) will fall short of the level of self irradiation which is required to greatly change the properties of glass (1018 &#945; decays per gram and 108 to 109 Gy of &#946; or &#947;). Also the rate of dissolution of the lava in water is very low (10?7 g-cm?2 day?1) suggesting that the lava is unlikely to dissolve in water.\r\n\r\nPossible consequences of further collapse of the Sarcophagus\r\nThe Sarcophagus, the concrete block surrounding reactor #4\r\n\r\nThe protective box which was placed over the wrecked reactor was named object "Shelter" by the Soviet government, but the media and the public know it as the sarcophagus.\r\n\r\nThe present shelter is constructed atop the ruins of the reactor building. The two "Mammoth Beams" that support the roof of the shelter are resting partly upon the structurally unsound west wall of the reactor building that was damaged by the accident. The western end of the shelter roof was supported by a wall (at a point designated axis 50). This wall is reinforced concrete, which was cracked by the accident. In December 2006 the Designed Stabilisation Steel Structure (DSSS) was extended until 50% of the roof load (circa 400 tons) was transferred from the axis-50 wall to the DSSS. The DSSS is a yellow steel object which has been placed next to the wrecked reactor; it is 63 metres (207 ft) tall and has a series of cantilevers which extend through the western buttress wall, and intended to stabilise the sarcophagus. This was done because if the wall of the reactor building or the roof of the shelter were to collapse, then large amounts of radioactive dust and particles would be released directly into the atmosphere, resulting in a large new release of radioactivity into the environment.\r\n\r\nA further threat to the shelter is the concrete slab that formed the "Upper Biological Shield" (UBS), situated above the reactor prior to the accident. This concrete slab was thrown upwards by the explosion in the reactor core and now rests at approximately 15? from vertical. The position of the upper bioshield is considered inherently unsafe, as only debris supports it in its nearly upright position. A collapse of the bioshield would further exacerbate the dust conditions in the shelter, possibly spreading some quantity of radioactive materials out of the shelter, and could damage the shelter itself.\r\n\r\nThe sarcophagus was never designed to last for the 100 years needed to contain the worst of the radioactivity found within the remains of reactor 4. While present designs for a new shelter anticipate a lifetime of up to 100 years, that time is minuscule compared to the lifetime of the radioactive materials within the reactor. The construction and maintenance of a permanent sarcophagus that can completely contain the remains of reactor 4 will present a continuing task to engineers for many generations to come. If the Chernobyl plant were to collapse, a large release of radioactive dust would occur, but it would likely be a one-time event.\r\n\r\nGrass and forest fires\r\n\r\nGrass and forest fires have happened inside the contaminated zone, releasing radioactive fallout into the atmosphere. In 1986 a series of fires destroyed 23.36 km? (5,772 acres) of forest, and several other fires have since burned within the 30 km (19 mi) zone. In early May 1992 a serious fire occurred which affected 5 km? (1,240 acres) of land including 2.7 km? (670 acres) of forest. This resulted in a great increase in the levels of caesium in airborne dust.\r\n\r\nIt is known that fires can make the radioactivity mobile again. In particular V.I. Yoschenko et al. reported on the possibility of increased mobility of caesium, strontium, and plutonium due to grass and forest fires.[73] As an experiment, fires were set and the levels of the radioactivity in the air down wind of these fires was measured.\r\nRecovery process\r\n\r\nThe Chernobyl Shelter Fund was established in 1997 at the Denver G7 summit to finance the Shelter Implementation Plan (SIP). The plan calls for transforming the site into an ecologically safe condition through stabilization of the sarcophagus, followed by construction of a New Safe Confinement (NSC). While original cost estimate for the SIP was US$768 million, the 2006 estimate is $1.2 billion. The SIP is being managed by a consortium of Bechtel, Battelle, and Electricit? de France, and conceptual design for the NSC consists of a movable arch, constructed away from the shelter to avoid high radiation, to be slid over the sarcophagus. The NSC is expected to be completed in 2012, and will be the largest movable structure ever built.\r\n\r\nDimensions:\r\n\r\n    * Span: 270 m (886 ft)\r\n    * Height: 100 m (330 ft)\r\n    * Length: 150 m (492 ft)\r\n\r\nThe United Nations Development Programme has launched in 2003 a specific project called the Chernobyl Recovery and Development Programme (CRDP) for the recovery of the affected areas. The programme launched its activities based on the Human Consequences of the Chernobyl Nuclear Accident report recommendations and has been initiated in February 2002. The main goal of the CRDP?s activities is supporting the Government of Ukraine to mitigate long-term social, economic and ecological consequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe, among others. CRDP works in the four most Chernobyl-affected areas in Ukraine: Kyivska, Zhytomyrska, Chernihivska and Rivnenska.\r\n\r\nThe International Project on the Health Effects of the Chernobyl Accident (IPEHCA) was created and received $20 million US, mainly from Japan, in hopes of discovering the main cause of health problems due to I131 radiation. These funds that were given to IPEHCA where divided between Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia, the three main affected countries, for further investigation of health effects. As corruption played an important role of the former Soviet countries, most of the foreign aid was given to Russia, and no positive outcome from this money was ever shown.\r\n\r\nAssessing the disaster''s effects on human health\r\n\r\n    Main article: Chernobyl disaster effects\r\n\r\nAn international assessment of the health effects of the Chernobyl accident is contained in a series of reports by the United Nations Scientific Committee of the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR). UNSCEAR was set up as a collaboration between various UN bodies, including the World Health Organisation, after the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, to assess the long-term effects of radiation on human health.\r\n\r\nUNSCEAR has conducted 20 years of detailed scientific and epidemiological research on the effects of the Chernobyl accident. Apart from the 57 direct deaths in the accident itself, UNSCEAR originally predicted up to 4,000 additional cancer cases due to the accident, however the latest UNSCEAR reports insinuate that these estimates were overstated. In addition, the IAEA states that there has been no increase in the rate of birth defects or abnormalities, or solid cancers (such as lung cancer) corroborating UNSCEAR''s assessments.\r\n\r\nPrecisely, UNSCEAR states:\r\n\r\n    "Among the residents of Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine there had been, up to 2002, about 4,000 cases of thyroid cancer reported in children and adolescents who were exposed at the time of the accident, and more cases are to be expected during the next decades. Notwithstanding problems associated with screening, many of those cancers were most likely caused by radiation exposures shortly after the accident. Apart from this increase, there is no evidence of a major public health impact attributable to radiation exposure 20 years after the accident. There is no scientific evidence of increases in overall cancer incidence or mortality rates or in rates of non-malignant disorders that could be related to radiation exposure. The risk of leukaemia in the general population, one of the main concerns owing to its short latency time, does not appear to be elevated. Although those most highly exposed individuals are at an increased risk of radiation-associated effects, the great majority of the population is not likely to experience serious health consequences as a result of radiation from the Chernobyl accident. Many other health problems have been noted in the populations that are not related to radiation exposure."\r\n\r\nThyroid cancer is generally treatable.The five year survival rate of thyroid cancer is 96%, and 92% after 30 years, with proper treatment.\r\n\r\nThe Chernobyl Forum is a regular meeting of IAEA, other United Nations organizations (FAO, UN-OCHA, UNDP, UNEP, UNSCEAR, WHO and The World Bank) and the governments of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine, which issues regular scientific assessments of the evidence for health effects of the Chernobyl accident. The Chernobyl Forum concluded that twenty-eight emergency workers died from acute radiation syndrome, 15 patients died from thyroid cancer, and it roughly estimated that cancers deaths caused by Chernobyl may reach a total of about 4000 among the 600 000 people having received the greatest exposures. It also concluded that a greater risk than the long-term effects of radiation exposure, is the risk to mental health of exaggerated fears about the effects of radiation:\r\n\r\n    " ... The designation of the affected population as ?victims? rather than ?survivors? has led them to perceive themselves as helpless, weak and lacking control over their future. This, in turn, has led either to over cautious behavior and exaggerated health concerns, or to reckless conduct, such as consumption of mushrooms, berries and game from areas still designated as highly contaminated, overuse of alcohol and tobacco, and unprotected promiscuous sexual activity."\r\n\r\nWhile it was commented by Fred Mettler that 20 years later:\r\n\r\n    The population remains largely unsure of what the effects of radiation actually are and retain a sense of foreboding. A number of adolescents and young adults who have been exposed to modest or small amounts of radiation feel that they are somehow fatally flawed and there is no downside to using illicit drugs or having unprotected sex. To reverse such attitudes and behaviors will likely take years although some youth groups have begun programs that have promise.\r\n\r\nIn addition, disadvantaged children around Chernobyl suffer from health problems which are not only to do with the Chernobyl accident, but also with the desperately poor state of post-Soviet health systems.\r\n\r\nAnother study critical of the Chernobyl Forum report was commissioned by Greenpeace, which is well known for its anti-nuclear positions. In its report, Greenpeace alleges that "the most recently published figures indicate that in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine alone the accident could have resulted in an estimated 200,000 additional deaths in the period between 1990 and 2004." However, the Greenpeace report failed to discriminate between the general increase in cancer rates that followed the dissolution of the USSR''s health system and any separate effects of the Chernobyl accident.\r\n\r\nLastly, in its report Health Effects of Chernobyl, the German affiliate of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW) argued that more than 10,000 people are today affected by thyroid cancer and 50,000 cases are expected in the future. According to some commentators, both the Greenpeace and IPPNW reports suffer from a lack of any genuine or original research and failure to understand epidemiologic data. This said, it is important to bear in mind that many of the conclusions from reports such as UNSCEAR remain disputed by other commentators and scientists in the field.\r\n\r\nIn the popular consciousness\r\n\r\n    Main article: Chernobyl in the popular consciousness\r\n    See also: Nuclear debate\r\n\r\nThe Chernobyl accident attracted a great deal of interest. Because of the distrust that many people had in the Soviet authorities (people both within and outside the USSR) a great deal of debate about the situation at the site occurred in the first world during the early days of the event. Due to defective intelligence based upon photographs taken from space, it was thought that unit number three had also suffered a dire accident.\r\n\r\nA few authors claim that the official reports underestimate the scale of the Chernobyl tragedy, counting only 30 victims some estimate the Chernobyl radioactive fallout as hundreds of times that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, counting millions of exposed.\r\n\r\nIn general the public knew little about radioactivity and radiation and as a result their degree of fear was increased. It was the case that many professionals (such as the spokesman from the UK NRPB) were mistrusted by journalists, who in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them.\r\n\r\nIt was noted that different governments tried to set contamination level limits which were stricter than the next country. In the dash to be seen to be protecting the public from radioactive food, it was often the case that the risk caused by the modification of the nations'' diet was greater and un-noticed.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, the fear of nuclear accidents was dramatically increased by the Chernobyl accident: this reflected in the outcome of the 1987 referendum about the construction of new nuclear plants in Italy. As effect of that referendum, Italy began phasing out its nuclear power plants in 1988.\r\n\r\nCommemoration of the disaster\r\n Chernobyl 20\r\n\r\nThis exhibit presents the stories of 20 people who have each been affected by the disaster, and each person''s account is written on a panel. The 20 individuals whose stories are related in the exhibition are from Belarus, France, Latvia, Russia, Sweden, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nDeveloped by Danish photo-journalist Mads Eskesen, the exhibition is prepared in multiple languages including in German, English, Danish, Dutch, Russian and Ukrainian.\r\n\r\nIn Kyiv, Ukraine, the exhibition was launched at the "Chernobyl 20 Remembrance for the Future" conference on 23 April 2006. It was then exhibited during 2006 in Australia, Denmark, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\r\n\r\n[edit] Representations in games\r\n\r\n    * Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare\r\n    * S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky\r\n    * S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl\r\n\r\n[edit] See also\r\n\r\nSelected Chernobyl articles\r\n\r\n    * Chernobyl compared to other radioactivity releases\r\n    * Chernobyl disaster effects\r\n    * Chernobyl Shelter Fund\r\n    * Liquidator (Chernobyl)\r\n    * List of Chernobyl-related articles\r\n    * Red Forest\r\n    * Zone of alienation\r\n\r\n	\r\n\r\nGeneral nuclear articles\r\n\r\n    * 1957 Mayak disaster\r\n    * 1957 Windscale fire\r\n    * 1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash\r\n    * 1979 Three Mile Island accident\r\n    * International Nuclear Events Scale\r\n    * Nuclear fuel response to reactor accidents\r\n    * Nuclear meltdown\r\n    * Nuclear power\r\n    * Radioactive contamination\r\n\r\nOther\r\n\r\n    * National Geographic Seconds From Disaster episodes\r\n\r\n[edit] Further reading\r\n\r\n    * Cheney, Glenn Alan (1995).

INSERT INTO `wiki` VALUES (32, 'BitTorrent (protocol)', '\r\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\r\nJump to: navigation, search\r\nThe BitTorrent logo\r\n\r\nBitTorrent is a peer-to-peer file sharing protocol used to distribute large amounts of data. BitTorrent is one of the most common protocols for transferring large files, and by some estimates it accounts for about 35% of all traffic on the entire Internet. The initial distributor of the complete file or collection acts as the first seed. Each peer who downloads the data also uploads it to other peers, even after they have dismounted the original seed. Because of this, BitTorrent is extremely efficient. One seed is needed to begin spreading files between many users (peers). The additions of more seeds increases the likelihood of a successful connection exponentially. Relative to standard Internet hosting, this provides a significant reduction in the original distributor''s hardware and bandwidth resource costs. It also provides redundancy against system problems and reduces dependence on the original distributor.\r\n\r\nProgrammer Bram Cohen designed the protocol in April 2001 and released a first implementation on July 2, 2001. It is now maintained by Cohen''s company BitTorrent, Inc. There are numerous BitTorrent clients available for a variety of computing platforms. According to isoHunt the total amount of shared content is currently more than 1.1 petabytes.\r\n\r\nOperation\r\nIn this animation, the coloured bars beneath all of the 7 clients in the upper region above represent individual pieces of the file. After the initial pieces transfer from the seed (large system at the bottom), the pieces are individually transferred from client to client. The original seeder only needs to send out one copy of the file for all the clients to receive a copy.\r\n\r\nA BitTorrent client is any program that implements the BitTorrent protocol. Each client is capable of preparing, requesting, and transmitting any type of computer file over a network, using the protocol. A peer is any computer running an instance of a client.\r\n\r\nTo share a file or group of files, a peer first creates a small file called a "torrent" (e.g. MyFile.torrent). This file contains metadata about the files to be shared and about the tracker, the computer that coordinates the file distribution. Peers that want to download the file must first obtain a torrent file for it, and connect to the specified tracker, which tells them from which other peers to download the pieces of the file.\r\n\r\nThough both ultimately transfer files over a network, a BitTorrent download differs from a classic full-file HTTP request in several fundamental ways:\r\n\r\n    * BitTorrent makes many small data requests over different TCP sockets, while web-browsers typically make a single HTTP GET request over a single TCP socket.\r\n    * BitTorrent downloads in a random or in a "rarest-first" approach that ensures high availability, while HTTP downloads in a sequential manner.\r\n\r\nTaken together, these differences allow BitTorrent to achieve much lower cost to the content provider, much higher redundancy, and much greater resistance to abuse or to "flash crowds" than a regular HTTP server. However, this protection comes at a cost: downloads can take time to rise to full speed because it may take time for enough peer connections to be established, and it takes time for a node to receive sufficient data to become an effective uploader. As such, a typical BitTorrent download will gradually rise to very high speeds, and then slowly fall back down toward the end of the download. This contrasts with an HTTP server that, while more vulnerable to overload and abuse, rises to full speed very quickly and maintains this speed throughout.\r\n\r\nIn general, BitTorrent''s non-contiguous download methods have prevented it from supporting "progressive downloads" or "streaming playback". But comments made by Bram Cohen in January 2007 suggest that streaming torrent downloads will soon be commonplace and ad supported streaming appears to be the result of those comments.\r\n\r\n[edit] Creating and publishing torrents\r\n\r\nThe peer distributing a data file treats the file as a number of identically-sized pieces, typically between 64 kB and 4 MB each. The peer creates a checksum for each piece, using the SHA1 hashing algorithm, and records it in the torrent file. Pieces with sizes greater than 512 kB will reduce the size of a torrent file for a very large payload, but is claimed to reduce the efficiency of the protocol . When another peer later receives a particular piece, the checksum of the piece is compared to the recorded checksum to test that the piece is error-free. Peers that provide a complete file are called seeders, and the peer providing the initial copy is called the initial seeder.\r\n\r\nThe exact information contained in the torrent file depends on the version of the BitTorrent protocol. By convention, the name of a torrent file has the suffix .torrent. Torrent files have an "announce" section, which specifies the URL of the tracker, and an "info" section, containing (suggested) names for the files, their lengths, the piece length used, and a SHA-1 hash code for each piece, all of which is used by clients to verify the integrity of the data they receive.\r\n\r\nTorrent files are typically published on websites or elsewhere, and registered with a tracker. The tracker maintains lists of the clients currently participating in the torrent. Alternatively, in a trackerless system (decentralized tracking) every peer acts as a tracker. This is implemented by the BitTorrent, ?Torrent, rTorrent, KTorrent, BitComet, and Deluge clients through the distributed hash table (DHT) method. Vuze also supports a trackerless method that is incompatible (as of April 2007) with the DHT offered by all other supporting clients although it did develop DHT first.\r\n\r\n[edit] Downloading torrents and sharing files\r\n\r\nUsers browse the web to find a torrent of interest, download it, and open it with a BitTorrent client. The client connects to the tracker(s) specified in the torrent file, from which it receives a list of peers currently transferring pieces of the file(s) specified in the torrent. The client connects to those peers to obtain the various pieces. Such a group of peers connected to each other to share a torrent is called a swarm. If the swarm contains only the initial seeder, the client connects directly to it and begins to request pieces. As peers enter the swarm, they begin to trade pieces with one another, instead of downloading directly from the seeder.\r\n\r\nClients incorporate mechanisms to optimize their download and upload rates; for example they download pieces in a random order to increase the opportunity to exchange data, which is only possible if two peers have different pieces of the file.\r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of this data exchange depends largely on the policies that clients use to determine to whom to send data. Clients may prefer to send data to peers who send data back to them (a tit for tat scheme), which encourages fair trading. But strict policies often result in suboptimal situations, such as when newly joined peers are unable to receive any data because they don''t have any pieces yet to trade themselves or when two peers with a good connection between them do not exchange data simply because neither of them wants to take the initiative. To counter these effects, the official BitTorrent client program uses a mechanism called ?optimistic unchoking?, where the client reserves a portion of its available bandwidth for sending pieces to random peers (not necessarily known-good partners, so called preferred peers), in hopes of discovering even better partners and to ensure that newcomers get a chance to join the swarm.\r\n\r\n[edit] Adoption\r\n\r\nA growing number of individuals and organizations are using BitTorrent to distribute their own or licensed material. Independent adopters report that without using BitTorrent technology and its dramatically reduced demands on networking hardware and bandwidth, they could not afford to distribute their files.\r\n\r\n[edit] Film, video and music\r\n\r\n    * BitTorrent Inc. has amassed a number of licenses from Hollywood studios for distributing popular content at the company''s website.\r\n    * Sub Pop Records releases tracks and videos via BitTorrent Inc.[8] to distribute its 1000+ albums. The band Ween uses the website Browntracker.net to distribute free audio and video recordings of live shows. Furthermore, Babyshambles and The Libertines (both bands associated with Pete Doherty) have extensively used torrents to distribute hundreds of demos and live videos.\r\n    * Podcasting software is starting to integrate BitTorrent to help podcasters deal with the download demands of their MP3 "radio" programs. Specifically, Juice and Miro (formerly known as Democracy Player) support automatic processing of .torrent files from RSS feeds. Similarly, some BitTorrent clients, such as ?Torrent, are able to process web feeds and automatically download content found within them.\r\n\r\n[edit] Broadcasters\r\n\r\n    * In 2008 CBC became the first public broadcaster in North America to make a full show (Canada''s Next Great Prime Minister) available for download using BitTorrent.\r\n    * The Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) has since March 2008 experimented with bittorrent distribution from this site. Only selected material in which NRK owns all royalties are published. Responses have been very positive, and NRK is planning to offer more content.\r\n\r\n[edit] Personal material\r\n\r\n    * The Amazon S3 "Simple Storage Service" is a scalable Internet-based storage service with a simple web service interface, equipped with built-in BitTorrent support.\r\n    * Blog Torrent offers a simplified BitTorrent tracker to enable bloggers and non-technical users to host a tracker on their site. Blog Torrent also allows visitors to download a "stub" loader, which acts as a BitTorrent client to download the desired file, allowing users without BitTorrent software to use the protocol. This is similar to the concept of a self-extracting archive.\r\n\r\n[edit] Software\r\n\r\n    * Blizzard Entertainment uses BitTorrent (via a proprietary client called the "Blizzard Downloader") to distribute most content for World of Warcraft, including the game itself.\r\n    * Many major open source and free software projects encourage BitTorrent as well as conventional downloads (HTTP, FTP...) of their products to increase availability and reduce load on their own servers, especially when dealing with larger files.\r\n\r\n[edit] Network impact\r\n\r\nCableLabs, the research organization of the North American cable industry, estimates that BitTorrent represents 18% of all broadband traffic. In 2004, CacheLogic put that number at roughly 35% of all traffic on the Internet. The discrepancies in these numbers are caused by differences in the method used to measure P2P traffic on the Internet.\r\n\r\nRouters that use NAT, Network address translation, must maintain tables of source and destination IP addresses and ports. Typical home routers are limited to about 2000 table entries while some more expensive routers have larger table capacities. BitTorrent frequently contacts 300-500 servers per second rapidly filling the NAT tables. This is a common cause of home routers locking up.\r\n\r\n[edit] Indexing\r\n\r\nThe BitTorrent protocol provides no way to index torrent files. As a result, a comparatively small number of websites have hosted the large majority of torrents linking to (possibly) copyrighted material, rendering those sites especially vulnerable to lawsuits. Several types of websites support the discovery and distribution of data on the BitTorrent network.\r\n\r\nPublic tracker sites such as The Pirate Bay allow users to search in and download from their collection of .torrent files; they also run BitTorrent trackers for those files. Users can typically also upload .torrent files for content they wish to distribute.\r\n\r\nPrivate tracker sites such as Demonoid operate like public ones except that they restrict access to registered users and keep track of the amount of data each user uploads and downloads, in an attempt to reduce leeching.\r\n\r\nThere are specialized tracker sites such as FlixFlux for films, MVGroup for educational content, Metal-Torrents.com for metal music, cheggit.net for pornographic content, and tv torrents for television series. Often these will also be private.\r\n\r\nSearch engines allow the discovery of .torrent files that are hosted and tracked on other sites; examples include Mininova, Monova, BTJunkie, Torrentz and isoHunt. These sites allow the user to ask for content meeting specific criteria (such as containing a given word or phrase) and retrieve a list of links to .torrent files matching those criteria. This list is often sorted with respect to relevance or number of seeders. Bram Cohen launched a BitTorrent search engine on http://search.bittorrent.com that commingles licensed content with search results. Metasearch engines allow to search several BitTorrent indices and search engines at once.\r\n\r\n[edit] Limitations and security vulnerabilities\r\n\r\n[edit] Lack of anonymity\r\n\r\nBitTorrent does not offer its users anonymity. It is possible to obtain the IP addresses of all current, and possibly previous, participants in a swarm from the tracker. This may expose users with insecure systems to attacks. Some clients such as ?Torrent get around this to an extent by running data transfer through multiple peers. This makes it harder to trace back the source or destination of an individual piece.\r\n\r\n[edit] The leech problem\r\n\r\nA BitTorrent user may often choose to leave the swarm as soon as they have a complete copy of the file they are downloading, freeing up their outbound bandwidth for other uses. If enough users follow this pattern, torrent swarms gradually die out, meaning a lower possibility of obtaining older torrents. Some BitTorrent websites have attempted to address this by recording each user''s download and upload ratio for all or just the user to see, as well as the provision of access to newer torrent files to people with better ratios. Users who have low upload ratios may see slower download speeds until they upload more. This prevents (statistical) leeching, since after a while they become unable to download at even a fraction of the theoretical bandwidth of their connection. Some trackers exempt dial-up users from this policy, because their uploading capabilities are limited.\r\n\r\n[edit] The leech compensation problem\r\n\r\nTo combat this leeching problem, some seeders deliberately withhold one final piece from the seed[citation needed], thus leaving a large number of potential seeders once they receive the withheld piece of data. With clients each awaiting that one final piece, the seeder ensures that there will be many more seeds once the final piece is released.\r\n\r\nIt is considered good etiquette to utilize the "Share Ratio" data, and equal (1.0 ratio) or double (2.0 ratio) one''s leeching. This provides an opportunity for one to compensate for one''s own leeching, and support the torrent, and nature of the protocol. This is most easily accomplished with a high-speed connection; those using dial-up will not be able to conform easily to this rule of etiquette. Also, it should be noted that many Internet providers still have restrictions as to the amount of traffic generated over a certain period of time. As such it is likely for users with such Internet connections to minimize their share ratio.\r\n\r\n[edit] The cheater problem\r\n\r\nThere are "cheating" clients like BitThief which claim to be able to download without uploading. Such exploitation negatively affects the cooperative nature of the BitTorrent protocol, although it might prove useful for people in countries where uploading copyrighted material is illegal, but downloading is not.\r\n\r\n[edit] Technologies built on BitTorrent\r\n\r\nThe BitTorrent protocol is still under development and therefore may still acquire new features and other enhancements such as improved efficiency.\r\n\r\n[edit] Distributed trackers\r\n\r\nIn June 2005, BitTorrent, Inc. released version 4.2.0 of the Mainline BitTorrent client. This release supported "trackerless" torrents, featuring a DHT implementation which allowed the client to use torrents that do not have a working BitTorrent tracker. Current versions of the official BitTorrent client, ?Torrent, BitComet, and BitSpirit all share a compatible DHT implementation that is based on Kademlia. Vuze uses its own incompatible DHT system called the "distributed database", but a plugin is available which allows use of the mainline DHT.\r\n\r\nAnother idea that has surfaced in Vuze is that of virtual torrents. This idea is based on the distributed tracker approach and is used to describe some web resource. Currently, it is used for instant messaging. It is implemented using a special messaging protocol and requires an appropriate plugin. Anatomic P2P is another approach, which uses a decentralized network of nodes that route traffic to dynamic trackers.\r\n\r\nMost BitTorrent clients also use Peer exchange (PEX) to gather peers in addition to trackers and DHT. Peer exchange checks with known peers to see if they know of any other peers. With the 3.0.5.0 release of Azureus, now known as Vuze, all major BitTorrent clients now have compatible peer exchange.\r\n\r\n[edit] Web seeding\r\n\r\nWeb seeding was implemented in 2006 as the ability of BitTorrent clients to download torrent pieces from an HTTP source in addition to the swarm. The advantage of this feature is that a site may distribute a torrent for a particular file or batch of files and make those files available for download from that same web server; this can simplify seeding and load balancing greatly once support for this feature is implemented in the various BitTorrent clients. In theory, this would make using BitTorrent almost as easy for a web publisher as simply creating a direct download while allowing some of the upload bandwidth demands to be placed upon the downloaders (who normally use only a very small portion of their upload bandwidth capacity). This feature was created by John "TheSHAD0W" Hoffman, who created BitTornado.. From version 5.0 onward the Mainline BitTorrent client also supports web seeds and the BitTorrent web site has a simple publishing tool that creates web seeded torrents. ?Torrent added support for web seeds in version 1.7. The latest version of the popular download manager GetRight supports downloading a file from HTTP, FTP, and BitTorrent protocols.\r\n\r\n[edit] RSS feeds\r\n\r\nA technique called Broadcatching combines RSS with the BitTorrent protocol to create a content delivery system, further simplifying and automating content distribution. Steve Gillmor explained the concept in a column for Ziff-Davis in December, 2003. The discussion spread quickly among bloggers (Techdirt, Ernest Miller, Chris Pirillo, etc.). In an article entitled Broadcatching with BitTorrent, Scott Raymond explained:\r\n\r\n    I want RSS feeds of BitTorrent files. A script would periodically check the feed for new items, and use them to start the download. Then, I could find a trusted publisher of an Alias RSS feed, and ''subscribe'' to all new episodes of the show, which would then start downloading automatically ? like the ''season pass'' feature of the TiVo.\r\n    ?\r\n\r\nThe RSS feed will track the content, while BitTorrent ensures content integrity with cryptographic hashing of all data, so feed subscribers will receive uncorrupted content.\r\n\r\nOne of the first software clients (free and open source) for broadcatching is Miro. Other free software clients such as PenguinTV and KatchTV are also now supporting broadcatching.\r\n\r\nThe BitTorrent web-service MoveDigital has the ability to make torrents available to any web application capable of parsing XML through its standard Representational State Transfer (REST) based interface. Additionally, Torrenthut is developing a similar torrent API that will provide the same features, as well as further intuition to help bring the torrent community to Web 2.0 standards. Alongside this release is a first PHP application built using the API called PEP, which will parse any Really Simple Syndication (RSS 2.0) feed and automatically create and seed a torrent for each enclosure found in that feed.\r\n\r\n[edit] Encryption\r\n\r\n    Main article: BitTorrent protocol encryption\r\n\r\nSince BitTorrent makes up a large proportion of total traffic, some ISPs have chosen to throttle (slow down) BitTorrent transfers to ensure network capacity remains available for other uses. For this reason methods have been developed to disguise BitTorrent traffic in an attempt to thwart these efforts.\r\n\r\nProtocol header encrypt (PHE) and Message stream encryption/Protocol encryption (MSE/PE) are features of some BitTorrent clients that attempt to make BitTorrent hard to detect and throttle. At the moment Vuze, Bitcomet, KTorrent, Transmission, Deluge, ?Torrent, MooPolice, Halite, rTorrent and the latest official BitTorrent client (v6) support MSE/PE encryption.\r\n\r\nIn September 2006 it was reported that some software could detect and throttle BitTorrent traffic masquerading as HTTP traffic.\r\n\r\nReports in August 2007 indicated that Comcast was preventing BitTorrent seeding by monitoring and interfering with the communication between peers. Protection against these efforts is provided by proxying the client-tracker traffic through the Tor anonymity network or, via an encrypted tunnel to a point outside of the Comcast network. Comcast has more recently called a ''truce'' with BitTorrent, Inc. with the intention of shaping traffic in a protocol-agnostic manner. Questions about the ethics and legality of Comcast''s behavior have led to renewed debate about Net neutrality in the United States.\r\n\r\nIn general, although encryption can make it difficult to determine what is being shared, BitTorrent is vulnerable to traffic analysis. Thus even with MSE/PE, it may be possible for an ISP to recognize BitTorrent and also to determine that a system is no longer downloading, only uploading, information and terminate its connection by injecting TCP RST (reset flag) packets.\r\n\r\n[edit] Multitracker\r\n\r\nAnother unofficial feature is an extension to the BitTorrent metadata format proposed by John Hoffman and implemented by several indexing websites. It allows the use of multiple trackers per file, so if one tracker fails, others can continue supporting file transfer. It is implemented in several clients, such as Vuze, BitComet, BitTornado, KTorrent and ?Torrent. Trackers are placed in groups, or tiers, with a tracker randomly chosen from the top tier and tried, moving to the next tier if all the trackers in the top tier fail.\r\n\r\nTorrents with multiple trackers can decrease the time it takes to download a file, but also has a few consequences:\r\n\r\n    * Users have to contact more trackers, leading to more overhead-traffic.\r\n    * Torrents from closed trackers suddenly become downloadable by non-members, as they can connect to a seed via an open tracker.\r\n\r\n[edit] Decentralized keyword search\r\n\r\nEven with distributed trackers, a third party is still required to find a specific torrent. This is usually done in the form of a direct hyperlink from the website of the content owner or through indexing websites like The Pirate Bay or Torrentz.\r\n\r\nIn May 2007 Cornell University published a paper proposing a new approach to searching a peer-to-peer network for inexact strings which could replace the functionality of a central indexing site. A year later, the same team implemented the system as a plugin for Vuze called Cubit and published a follow-up paper reporting its success.\r\n\r\n[edit] Implementations\r\n\r\n    Main article: Comparison of BitTorrent software\r\n\r\nBecause of the open nature of the protocol, many clients have been developed that support numerous platforms and written using various programming languages. The official client is also named BitTorrent.\r\n\r\nSome clients, like Torrentflux, can be run straight from a server, allowing hosting companies to offer speeds unavailable to most users. Sites such as Torrent2FTP offer services to download torrents and then make them available to the customer on a FTP server.\r\n\r\nTorrentRelay is a service that allows users to load torrents remotely and have them download as a simple HTTP link. Unlike Torrent2FTP this site offers a free version that isn''t the common PHP based Torrentflux that has been widely available for years. This implementation offers some unique features such as ZIP compression, RAR decompression and Playstation 3 streaming & download support, that aren''t seen in any other client to date.\r\n\r\nWeb based services such as the now very popular TorrentRelay mentioned above overcome all forms of throttling, firewalls (school, company, etc), NAT issues or ISP restrictions because their traffic is standard HTTP.\r\n\r\nOpera Software now incorporates BitTorrent downloads through its popular browser software, as does Wyzo.\r\n\r\nAn increasing number of hardware devices are being made to support BitTorrent. These include routers and NAS devices, as well as anything capable of running OpenWrt (routers) or Openslug (NAS).\r\n\r\nProprietary version of the protocol that implement DRM, encryption, and authentication are found within managed clients such as Pando.\r\n\r\n[edit] Development\r\n\r\nAn as-yet (2 February 2008) unimplemented unofficial feature is Similarity Enhanced Transfer (SET), a technique for improving the speed at which peer-to-peer file sharing and content distribution systems can share data. SET, proposed by researchers Pucha, Andersen, and Kaminsky, works by spotting chunks of identical data in files that are an exact or near match to the one needed and transferring these data to the client if the ''exact'' data are not present. Their experiments suggested that SET will help greatly with less popular files, but not as much for popular data, where many peers are already downloading it. Andersen believes that this technique could be immediately used by developers with the BitTorrent file sharing system.\r\n\r\nDecember 2008 - Bittorrent Inc is working with Oversi on new Policy Discover Protocols that query the ISP for capabilities and network architecture information. Oversi''s ISP hosted NetEnhancer box is designed to "improve peer selection" by helping peers find local nodes, improving download speeds while reducing the loads into and out of the ISP''s network.\r\n\r\n[edit] Legal issues\r\n\r\n    Main article: Legal issues with BitTorrent\r\n\r\nThere has been much controversy over the use of BitTorrent trackers. BitTorrent metafiles themselves do not store copyrighted data, hence BitTorrent itself is not illegal?it is the use of it to copy copyrighted material that contravenes laws in some locations.\r\n\r\nVarious jurisdictions have pursued legal action against websites that host BitTorrent trackers. High-profile examples include the closing of Suprnova.org, Torrentspy, LokiTorrent, Demonoid (now back online), OiNK.cd and EliteTorrents.org. The Pirate Bay torrent website, formed by a Swedish group, is noted for the "legal" section of its website in which letters and replies on the subject of alleged copyright infringements are publicly displayed. On 31 May 2006, The Pirate Bay''s servers in Sweden were raided by Swedish police on allegations by the MPAA of copyright infringement; however, the tracker was up and running again three days later.\r\n\r\nHBO, in an effort to combat the distribution of its programming on BitTorrent networks, has sent cease and desist letters to the Internet Service Providers of BitTorrent users. Many users have reported receiving letters from their ISPs that threatened to cut off their Internet service if the alleged infringement continues. HBO, unlike the RIAA, has not been reported to have filed suit against anyone for sharing files as of April 2007. In 2005 HBO began "poisoning" torrents of its show Rome, by providing bad chunks of data to clients.\r\n\r\nOn 23 November 2005, the movie industry and BitTorrent Inc. CEO Bram Cohen, signed a deal they hoped would reduce the number of unlicensed copies available through bittorrent.com''s search engine, run by BitTorrent, Inc. It meant BitTorrent.com had to remove any links to unlicensed copies of films made by seven of Hollywood''s major movie studios.\r\n\r\nMore recently, the BitTorrent network has been subject to scrutiny by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). There are suggestions that they are using the network to obtain the IP addresses of those currently connected to the tracker. The information is then used to contact the ISP of each downloader so that notifications can be made (this was given sizeable coverage in the UK press with regard to Virgin Media sending letters out to customers suspected of using P2P networks).\r\n\r\nThere are two major differences between BitTorrent and many other peer-to-peer file-trading systems, which advocates suggest make it less useful to those sharing copyrighted material without authorization. First, BitTorrent itself does not offer a search facility to find files by name. A user must find the initial torrent file by other means, such as a web search. Second, BitTorrent makes no attempt to conceal the host ultimately responsible for facilitating the sharing: a person who wishes to make a file available must run a tracker on a specific host or hosts and distribute the tracker address(es) in the .torrent file. Because it is possible to operate a tracker on a server that is located in a jurisdiction where the copyright holder cannot take legal action, the protocol does offer some vulnerability that other protocols lack. It is far easier to request that the server''s ISP shut down the site than it is to find and identify every user sharing a file on a peer-to-peer network. However, with the use of a distributed hash table (DHT), trackers are no longer required, though often used for client software that does not support DHT to connect to the stream.\r\n\r\n[edit] See also\r\n	Free software portal\r\n\r\n    * Terminology of BitTorrent\r\n    * Super-seeding\r\n    * Segmented downloading\r\n    * Comparison of BitTorrent clients\r\n    * Magnet URI scheme\r\n    * Similarity Enhanced Transfer\r\n    * Bencode\r\n    * .sfv files in .torrents\r\n\r\n[edit] References\r\n\r\n   1. ^ http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/56403\r\n   2. ^ Cohen, Bram (2001-07-02).

He was inspired in part by reading The Golden Book of Chemistry Experiments, and tried to collect samples of every element in the periodic table, including the radioactive ones. Hahn diligently amassed this radioactive material by collecting small amounts from household products, such as americium from smoke detectors, thorium from camping lantern mantles, radium from clocks and tritium (as neutron moderator) from gunsights. His "reactor" was a large, cored-out block of lead, and he used lithium from $1,000 worth of stolen batteries to purify the thorium ash using a Bunsen burner.\r\n\r\nHahn posed as an adult scientist or professor to gain the trust of many professionals in letters, despite the presence of misspellings and obvious errors in his letters to them. Hahn ultimately hoped to create a breeder reactor, using low-level isotopes to transform samples of thorium and uranium into fissionable isotopes.\r\n\r\nAlthough his homemade reactor never achieved critical mass, it ended up emitting dangerous levels of radioactivity, likely well over 1,000 times normal background radiation. Alarmed, Hahn began to dismantle his experiments, but a chance encounter with police led to the discovery of his activities, which triggered a Federal Radiological Emergency Response involving the FBI and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The United States Environmental Protection Agency, having designated Hahn''s mother''s property as a Superfund hazardous materials cleanup site, dismantled the shed and its contents and buried them as low-level radioactive waste in Utah. Hahn refused medical evaluation for radiation exposure.\r\n\r\nHis mother, Patty, later committed suicide.\r\n\r\nCareer\r\n\r\nHahn suffered local shame, but did attain the rank of Eagle Scout. After dropping out of community college, Hahn joined the Navy, assigned to the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Enterprise as an ordinary seaman.\r\n\r\nHahn had hoped to pursue a nuclear specialist career, but was not even permitted to tour the reactors.[citation needed] EPA scientists believe that Hahn may have exceeded the lifetime dosage for thorium exposure, but he refused their recommendation that he be examined at the Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station. Later, Hahn re-enlisted as a Marine.\r\n\r\nMedia coverage\r\n\r\nThe incident received scant media attention at the time, but was widely disseminated after writer Ken Silverstein published an article about the incident in Harper''s Magazine in 1998[2]. In 2004 he expanded it into a book, The Radioactive Boy Scout.\r\n\r\nA television documentary, The Nuclear Boyscout, aired on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom in 2003. In it, Hahn reenacted some of his methods for the camera. Though slated to air on the Discovery Channel, the program has not yet been broadcast in the United States.\r\n\r\n2007 arrest\r\n\r\nOn August 1, 2007, Hahn was arrested in Clinton Township, Michigan for larceny, in relation to a matter involving several smoke detectors, allegedly removed from the halls of his apartment building. In his mug shot, his face is covered with sores which investigators claim are possibly from exposure to radioactive materials. During a Circuit Court hearing, Hahn pleaded guilty to attempted larceny of a building. The court?s online docket said prosecutors recommended that he be sentenced to time served and enter an inpatient treatment facility. Under terms of the plea, the original charge of larceny of a building would be dismissed at sentencing, scheduled for Oct. 4. He was sentenced to 90 days in jail for attempted larceny. Court records state that his sentence will be delayed by six months while Hahn undergoes treatment for radiation exposure.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n    * Ghiorso, Albert.

For the programming language, see ColdFusion, for other uses, see Cold Fusion .\r\n\r\nIn the broadest sense, cold fusion is any type of nuclear fusion accomplished without the high temperatures (millions of degrees Celsius) required for thermonuclear fusion. In common usage, "cold fusion" refers more narrowly to a postulated fusion process of unknown mechanism offered to explain a group of experimental results first reported by electrochemists Stanley Pons of the University of Utah and Martin Fleischmann of the University of Southampton.\r\n\r\nCold fusion gained attention in 1989 when Fleischmann and Pons held a news conference in which they reported producing nuclear fusion in a tabletop experiment involving electrolysis of heavy water on a palladium (Pd) electrode. They reported anomalous heat production ("excess heat") of a magnitude they asserted would defy explanation except in terms of nuclear processes. They further reported measuring small amounts of nuclear reaction byproducts, including neutrons and tritium. These reports raised hopes of a cheap and abundant source of energy.\r\n\r\nEnthusiasm turned to skepticism and scorn as a long series of failed replication attempts were weighed in view of several theoretical reasons cold fusion should not be possible, the discovery of possible sources of experimental error, and finally the discovery that Fleischmann and Pons had not actually detected nuclear reaction byproducts. Although cold fusion has gained a reputation as pathological science, some researchers continue to investigate cold fusion and publish their findings at conferences, in books, and scientific journals. The field is sometimes referred to as low energy nuclear reaction (LENR) studies or condensed matter nuclear science.\r\n\r\nThe majority of a review panel organized by the US Department of Energy (DOE) in 1989 found that the evidence for the discovery of a new nuclear process was not persuasive. In 2004, the DOE convened a second cold fusion review panel which reached conclusions that were similar to those of the 1989 panel.\r\n\r\n\r\n    * 1 History\r\n          o 1.1 Early work\r\n          o 1.2 Fleischmann-Pons announcement\r\n          o 1.3 Reaction to the announcement\r\n          o 1.4 Further developments\r\n    * 2 Experimental Details\r\n          o 2.1 Excess heat observations\r\n          o 2.2 Reports of nuclear products in association with excess heat\r\n          o 2.3 Evidence for nuclear transmutations\r\n          o 2.4 Non-nuclear explanations for excess heat\r\n    * 3 Incomptibilities with Established Physics\r\n          o 3.1 The probability of reaction\r\n          o 3.2 The branching ratio\r\n          o 3.3 &#947;-ray conversion to heat\r\n    * 4 See also\r\n    * 5 References\r\n    * 6 Bibliography\r\n\r\n[edit] History\r\n\r\n[edit] Early work\r\n\r\nThe ability of palladium to absorb hydrogen was recognized as early as the nineteenth century by Thomas Graham. In the late nineteen-twenties, two Austrian born scientists, Friedrich Paneth and Kurt Peters, originally reported the transformation of hydrogen into helium by spontaneous nuclear catalysis when hydrogen was absorbed by finely divided palladium at room temperature. However, the authors later retracted that report, acknowledging that the helium they measured was due to background from the air.\r\n\r\nIn 1927, Swedish scientist J. Tandberg stated that he had fused hydrogen into helium in an electrolytic cell with palladium electrodes. On the basis of his work, he applied for a Swedish patent for "a method to produce helium and useful reaction energy". After deuterium was discovered in 1932, Tandberg continued his experiments with heavy water. Due to Paneth and Peters'' retraction, Tandberg''s patent application was eventually denied.\r\n\r\nThe term "cold fusion" was coined by E. Paul Palmer of Brigham Young University in 1986 in an investigation of "geo-fusion", or the possible existence of fusion in a planetary core.\r\n\r\nFleischmann-Pons announcement\r\nElectrolysis cell schematic\r\n\r\nFleischmann and Pons hypothesized that the high compression ratio and mobility of deuterium that could be achieved within palladium metal using electrolysis might result in nuclear fusion. To investigate, they conducted electrolysis experiments using a palladium cathode and heavy water within a calorimeter, an insulated vessel designed to measure process heat. Current was applied continuously for many weeks, with the heavy water being renewed at intervals. Some deuterium was thought to be accumulating within the cathode, but most was allowed to bubble out of the cell, joining oxygen produced at the anode. For most of the time, the power input to the cell was equal to the calculated power leaving the cell within measurement accuracy, and the cell temperature was stable at around 30 ?C. But then, at some point (and in some of the experiments), the temperature rose suddenly to about 50 ?C without changes in the input power. These high temperature phases would last for two days or more and would repeat several times in any given experiment once they had occurred. The calculated power leaving the cell was significantly higher than the input power during these high temperature phases. Eventually the high temperature phases would no longer occur within a particular cell.\r\n\r\nIn 1988, Fleischmann and Pons applied to the United States Department of Energy for funding towards a larger series of experiments. Up to this point they had been funding their experiments using a small device built with $100,000 out-of-pocket. The grant proposal was turned over for peer review, and one of the reviewers was Steven E. Jones of Brigham Young University. Jones had worked on muon-catalyzed fusion for some time, and had written an article on the topic entitled "Cold nuclear fusion" that had been published in Scientific American in July 1987. Fleischmann and Pons and co-workers met with Jones and co-workers on occasion in Utah to share research and techniques. During this time, Fleischmann and Pons described their experiments as generating considerable "excess energy", in the sense that it could not be explained by chemical reactions alone.] They felt that such a discovery could bear significant commercial value and would be entitled to patent protection. Jones, however, was measuring neutron flux, which was not of commercial interest. In order to avoid problems in the future, the teams appeared to agree to simultaneously publish their results, although their accounts of their March 6 meeting differ.\r\n\r\nIn mid-March, both research teams were ready to publish their findings, and Fleischmann and Jones had agreed to meet at an airport on March 24 to send their papers to Nature via FedEx. Fleischmann and Pons, however, broke their apparent agreement, submitting their paper to the Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry on March 11, and disclosing their work via a press conference on March 23. Jones, upset, faxed in his paper to Nature after the press conference.\r\n\r\nReaction to the announcement\r\n\r\nFleischmann and Pons'' anouncement drew wide media attention. Scores of laboratories in the United States and abroad attempted to repeat the experiments. A few reported success, many others failure. Even those reporting success had difficulty reproducing Fleischmann and Pons'' results. One of the more prominent reports of success came from a group at the Georgia Institute of Technology, which observed neutron production.The Georgia Tech group later retracted their announcement.Another team, headed by Robert Huggins at Stanford University also reported early success, but this too was refuted.For weeks, competing claims, counterclaims and suggested explanations kept what was referred to as "cold fusion" or "fusion confusion" in the news.\r\n\r\nIn May 1989, the American Physical Society held a session on cold fusion, at which were heard many reports of experiments that failed to produce evidence of cold fusion. At the end of the session, eight of the nine leading speakers stated they considered the initial Fleischmann and Pons'' claim dead.\r\n\r\nIn April 1989, Fleischmann and Pons published a "preliminary note" in the Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry. This paper notably showed a gamma peak without its corresponding Compton edge, which indicated they had made a mistake in claiming evidence of fusion byproducts. The preliminary note was followed up a year later with a much longer paper that went into details of calorimetry but did not include any nuclear measurements.\r\n\r\nIn July and November 1989, Nature published papers critical of cold fusion claims.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Fleischmann and Pons and a number of other researchers who found positive results remained convinced of their findings. In August of 1989, the state of Utah invested $4.5 million to create the National Cold Fusion Institute.\r\n\r\nThe United States Department of Energy organized a special panel to review cold fusion theory and research. The panel issued its report in November 1989, concluding that results as of that date did not present convincing evidence that useful sources of energy would result from phenomena attributed to cold fusion. The panel noted the inconsistency of reports of excess heat and the greater inconsistency of reports of nuclear reaction byproducts. Nuclear fusion of the type postulated would be inconsistent with current understanding and would require the invention of an entirely new nuclear process. The panel was against special funding for cold fusion research, but supported modest funding of "focused experiments within the general funding system."\r\n\r\nIn the ensuing years, several books came out critical of cold fusion research methods and the conduct of cold fusion researchers.\r\n\r\nFurther developments\r\n\r\nCold fusion claims were, and still are, considered extraordinary. In view of the theoretical issues alone, most scientists would require extraordinarily conclusive data to be convinced that cold fusion has been discovered. After the fiasco following the Pons and Fleischmann announcement, most scientists became dismissive of new experimental claims.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there were positive results that kept some researchers interested and got new researchers involved.In September 1990, Fritz Will, Director of the National Cold Fusion Institute, compiled a list 92 groups of researchers from 10 different countries that had reported excess heat, 3H, 4He, neutrons or other nuclear effects.\r\n\r\nFleischmann and Pons relocated their laboratory to France under a grant from the Toyota Motor Corporation. The laboratory, IMRA, was closed in 1998 after spending ?12 million on cold fusion work.\r\n\r\nBetween 1992 and 1997, Japan''s Ministry of International Trade and Industry sponsored a "New Hydrogen Energy Program" of US$20 million to research cold fusion. Announcing the end of the program in 1997, Hideo Ikegami stated "We couldn''t achieve what was first claimed in terms of cold fusion." He added, "We can''t find any reason to propose more money for the coming year or for the future."\r\n\r\nIn 1994, David Goodstein described cold fusion as "a pariah field, cast out by the scientific establishment. Between cold fusion and respectable science there is virtually no communication at all. Cold fusion papers are almost never published in refereed scientific journals, with the result that those works don''t receive the normal critical scrutiny that science requires. On the other hand, because the Cold-Fusioners see themselves as a community under siege, there is little internal criticism. Experiments and theories tend to be accepted at face value, for fear of providing even more fuel for external critics, if anyone outside the group was bothering to listen. In these circumstances, crackpots flourish, making matters worse for those who believe that there is serious science going on here."\r\n\r\nCold fusion researchers contended that cold fusion research is being suppressed. They complained there was virtually no possibility of obtaining funding for cold fusion research in the United States, and no possibility of getting published. University researchers were unwilling to investigate cold fusion because they would be ridiculed by their colleagues. In a biography by Jagdish Mehra et al. it is mentioned that to the shock of most physicists, the Nobel Laureate Julian Schwinger declared himself a supporter of cold fusion and tried to publish a paper on it on the American Physical Society''s journal; when it was roundly rejected, in a manner that he considered deeply insulting, he resigned from that body in protest.\r\n\r\nTo provide a forum for researchers to share their results, the first International Conference on Cold Fusion was held in 1990. The conference, recently renamed the International Conference on Condensed Matter Nuclear Science, is held every 12 to 18 months in various countries around the world. The periodicals Fusion Facts, Cold Fusion Magazine, Infinite Energy Magazine, and New Energy Times were established in the 1990s to cover developments in cold fusion and related new energy sciences. In 2004 The International Society for Condensed Matter Nuclear Sciencewas formed "To promote the understanding, development and application of Condensed Matter Nuclear Science for the benefit of the public."\r\n\r\nIn February 2002, the U.S. Navy revealed that its researchers had been studying cold fusion on the quiet more or less continuously since 1989. Researchers at their Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center in San Diego, California released a two-volume report, entitled "Thermal and nuclear aspects of the Pd/D2O system," with a plea for proper funding.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, at the request of cold fusion advocates, the DOE organized a second review of the field. Cold fusion researchers presented a review document stating that the observation of excess heat has been reproduced, that it can be reproduced at will under the proper conditions, and that many of the reasons for failure to reproduce it have been discovered. 18 reviewers in total examined the written and oral testimony given by cold fusion researchers. On the question of excess heat, the reviewers'' opinions ranged from "evidence of excess heat is compelling" to "there is no convincing evidence that excess power is produced when integrated over the life of an experiment". The report states the reviewers were split approximately evenly on this topic. On the larger question of evidence for nuclear fusion, the report states:\r\n? 	Two-thirds of the reviewers...did not feel the evidence was conclusive for low energy nuclear reactions, one found the evidence convincing, and the remainder indicated they were somewhat convinced. Many reviewers noted that poor experiment design, documentation, background control and other similar issues hampered the understanding and interpretation of the results presented. 	?\r\n\r\nOn the question of further research, the report reads:\r\n? 	The nearly unanimous opinion of the reviewers was that funding agencies should entertain individual, well-designed proposals for experiments that address specific scientific issues relevant to the question of whether or not there is anomalous energy production in Pd/D systems, or whether or not D-D fusion reactions occur at energies on the order of a few eV. These proposals should meet accepted scientific standards, and undergo the rigors of peer review. No reviewer recommended a focused federally funded program for low energy nuclear reactions. 	?\r\n\r\nThirteen papers were presented at the "Cold Fusion" session of the March 2006 American Physical Society (APS) meeting in Baltimore. In 2007, the American Chemical Society''s (ACS) held an "invited symposium" on cold fusion and low-energy nuclear reactions. Cold fusion reports have been published in Naturwissenschaften, Japanese Journal of Applied Physics, European Physical Journal A, European Physical Journal C, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, Journal of Solid State Phenomena, Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry, and Journal of Fusion Energy. Nevertheless, new reports of excess heat and other cold fusion effects are met with skepticism.\r\n\r\nCold fusion researchers have described possible cold fusion mechanisms, but they have not received mainstream acceptance.\r\n\r\nExperimental Details\r\n\r\nA cold fusion experiment usually includes:\r\n\r\n    * a metal, such as palladium or nickel, in bulk, thin films or powder;\r\n    * deuterium and/or hydrogen, in the form of water, gas or plasma; and\r\n    * an excitation in the form of electricity, magnetism, temperature, pressure, laser beam(s), or of acoustic waves.\r\n\r\nElectrolysis cells can be either open cell or closed cell. In open cell systems, the electrolyis products, which are gaseous, are allowed to leave the cell. In closed cell experiments, the products are captured, for example by catalytically recombining the products in a separate part of the experimental system. These experiments generally strive for a steady state condition, with the electrolyte being replaced periodically. There are also "heat after death" experiments, where the evolution of heat is monitored after the electric current is turned off.\r\n\r\nExcess heat observations\r\n\r\nAn excess heat observation is based on an energy balance. Various sources of energy input and output are continuously measured. Under normal condition, the energy input can be matched to the energy output to within experimental error. In experiments such as those run by Fleischmann and Pons, a cell operating steadily at one temperature transitions to operating at a higher temperature with no increase in applied current. At the higher temperature, the energy balance shows an unaccounted term. In the Fleischmann and Pons experiments, the rate of excess heat generation was in the range of 10-20% of total input. The high temperature condition would last for an extended period, making the total excess heat disproportionate to what might be obtained by ordinary chemical reaction of the material contained within the cell at any one time. These high temperature phases did not last indefinitely and did not occur in every experiment, but in those experiments where they did occur, they would usually reoccur several times. Many others have reported similar results.\r\n\r\nA 2007 review determined that more than 10 groups world wide reporting measurements of excess heat in 1/3 of their experiments using electrolysis of heavy water in open and/or closed electrochemical cells, or deuterium gas loading onto Pd powders under pressure. Most of the research groups reported occasionally seeing 50-200% excess heat for periods lasting hours or days.\r\n\r\nIn 1993, Fleischmann reported "heat-after-death" experiments: he observed the continuing generation of excess heat after the electric current supplied to the electrolytic cell was turned off. Similar observations have been reported by others as well.\r\n\r\nReports of nuclear products in association with excess heat\r\nPurported nuclear activity in a CR-39 detector from experiments at SSC San Diego.\r\n\r\nIn association with excess heat, researchers have reported observing gamma rays, neutrons, and tritium (3H) production.Mosier-Boss et al. 2008</ref> Although these reports do not measure quantities commensurate with a rate of deuterium fusion that would account for the excess heat, the quantities were reported to be in excess of background levels.\r\n\r\nConsiderable attention has been given to measuring 4He production. In the report presented to the DOE in 2004, 4He was detected in five out of sixteen cases where electrolytic cells were producing excess heat, although the amounts detected were very close to background levels and contamination by trace amounts of helium normally present in the air is difficult to avoid.\r\n\r\nEvidence for nuclear transmutations\r\n\r\nThere have been reports that small amounts of copper and other metals can appear within Pd electrodes used in cold fusion experiments. Iwamura et al. report transmuting Cs to Pr and Sr to Mo, with the mass number increasing by 8, and the atomic number by 4 in either case. Cs or Sr was applied to the surface of a Pd complex consisting of a thin Pd layer, alternating CaO and Pd layers, and bulk Pd. Deuterium was diffused through this complex. The surface was analyzed periodically with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and at the end of the experiment with glow discharge mass spectrometry.[69] Production of such heavy nuclei is so unexpected from current understanding of nuclear reactions that extraordinary experimental proof will be needed to convince the scientific community of these results.\r\n\r\nNon-nuclear explanations for excess heat\r\n\r\nThe calculation of excess heat in electrochemical cells involves certain assumptions. Errors in these assumptions have been offered as non-nuclear explanations for excess heat.\r\n\r\nOne assumption made by Fleishmann and Pons is the efficiency of electrolysis is nearly 100%, meaning they assumed nearly all the electricity applied to the cell resulted in electrolysis of water, with negligible resistive heating and substantially all the electrolysis product leaving the cell unchanged.] This assumption gives the amount of energy expended converting liquid D2O into gaseous D2 and O2.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of electrolysis will be less than one if hydrogen and oxygen recombine to a significant extent within the calorimeter. Several researchers have described potential mechanisms by which this process could occur and thereby account for excess heat in electrolyis experiments.\r\n\r\nAnother assumption is that heat loss from the calorimeter maintains the same relationship with measured temperature as found when calibrating the calorimeter. This assumption ceases to be accurate if the temperature distribution within the cell becomes significantly altered from the condition under which calibration measurements were made. This can happen, for example, if fluid circulation within the cell becomes significantly altered. Recombination of hydrogen and oxygen within the calorimeter would also alter the heat distribution and invalidate the calibration.\r\n\r\nIncomptibilities with Established Physics\r\n\r\nPostulating cold fusion to explain experimental results raises at least three separate theoretical problems.\r\n\r\nThe probability of reaction\r\n\r\nBecause nuclei are all positively charged, they strongly repel one another.Normally, very high energies are required to overcome this repulsion. Extrapolating from known rates at high energies, the rate at room temperature would be 50 orders of magnitude lower than needed to account for the reported excess heat.\r\n\r\nThe branching ratio\r\n\r\nFusion is a two-step process.In the case of deuterium fusion, the first step is combination to form a high energy intermediary:\r\n\r\n    D + D &#8594; 4He + 24 MeV\r\n\r\nIn high energy experiments, this intermediary has been observed to quickly decay through three pathways:[88]\r\n\r\n    n + 3He + 3.3 MeV (50%)\r\n    p + 3H + 4.0 MeV (50%)\r\n    4He + &#947; + 24 MeV (10-6)\r\n\r\nThe first two pathways are equally probable, and if one watt of nuclear power were produced, the neutron and tritium production would be easy to measure.Based on attempts to detect neutrons and tritium (3H), the actual rates of the first two pathways are at least five orders of magnitude too low, meaning the branching probabilities given above would have to be completely reversed to strongly favor the third pathway.\r\n\r\n[&#947;-ray conversion to heat\r\n\r\nThe &#947;-rays of the 4He pathway, are not observed. This type of radiation is not stopped by electrode or electrolyte materials, making it necessary to postulate that the 24 MeV excess energy is transferred into the host metal lattice prior to the intermediary''s decay. The speed of the decay process together with the inter-atomic spacing makes such a transfer inexplicable in terms of conventional understandings of momentum and energy transfer.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee also\r\n\r\n    * Bubble fusion\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n   1. ^ Voss 1999\r\n   2. ^ Fleischmann & Pons 1989, p. 301 ("It is inconceivable that this [amount of heat] could be due to anything but nuclear processes.")\r\n   3. ^ Fleischmann & Pons 1989, p. 301 ("We realise that the results reported here raise more questions than they provide answers . . .")\r\n   4. ^ Browne 1989, para. 1\r\n   5. ^ Browne (1989-05-03).

Since this only works when a shaped peer can connect to any peer in the swarm with the crypto header it is currently not possible to turn this feature off.\r\n\r\nThis feature does NOT provide anonymity and only very limited confidentiality, i.e. if somebody is in possession of the correct infohash he can obtain your IP/Port combination from public sources like a tracker or from other clients via PEX he will be able to connect to you as usual. Only a passive listener can''t determine what you''re downloading.\r\n[edit]\r\nWhen to turn it on\r\n\r\nGenerally this feature will not help you with any kind of download speed or other problems unless\r\n\r\n    * you''re affected by P2P/BitTorrent traffic shaping or it is completely blocked (see Bad ISPs)\r\n    * you''re on torrents with a large fraction of traffic shaped users\r\n    * you want to hide what protocol you''re using from passive surveillance (it is not for those who seek anonymity) \r\n\r\nPlease note: You should make sure that you don''t violate any rules (e.g. ''reasonable use'' clauses) that are associated with your internet connection such as the contract with your ISP.\r\n\r\nSo before you turn this feature on you should verify you have good settings and no NAT problem.\r\n[edit]\r\nThe settings\r\n\r\nTo enable the encryption you have to switch to intermediate user mode and go to Tools -> Options -> Connection -> Transport Encryption and enable the Require encrypted transport checkbox.\r\n\r\nEnabling this feature instructs to establish connections with the crypto handshake, which will consume more CPU time due to the D-H key exchange. If it is disabled Azureus will only use the obfuscation header for peers that either require that via PEX/DHT or when a remote peer initiates a crypto connection.\r\n\r\nFurther details are controlled by the following settings:\r\n\r\nMinimum encryption level\r\n    this will specify the minimal encryption level you will choose when establish encrypted connections, currently available are\r\n\r\n       1. Plain: This only uses the obfuscation header and transmits the entire payload unencrypted. It''s still easy to identify but might be enough to confuse simple traffic shapers\r\n       2. RC4: This mode uses strong cryptography to obfuscate the traffic and is only attackable with very sophisticated and expensive attacks but it consumes more CPU time than the Plain method. \r\n\r\nAllow non-encrypted outgoing connections if encrypted connection attempt fails 2\r\n    This option ensures compatibility with legacy clients that don''t support the traffic obfuscation but makes it easier for the ISP to identify users that engage in BitTorrent activity. \r\nAllow non-encrypted incoming connections\r\n    Disabling this option will prevent any peer from connecting to you unless he uses the obfuscation header. Thus it even prevent peers from connecting to you when they support encryption but don''t know that you require it. But as stated in the implementation specs Azureus'' PEX and Distributed tracker is obfuscation aware and thus tells other peers to use it even when they default encryption to off.\r\n    Enabling this option may be necessary when the ISP limits ports instead of single connections. \r\n\r\n\r\nEscalation of the crypto settings\r\n\r\nSince different methods of traffic shaping and protocol discovery exist different levels of shaping avoidance are necessary. The following configuration options are listed in ascending order.\r\n\r\nIt''s suggested to use one of the first 3 combinations unless there is evidence that more drastic steps are necessary. If you turn off fallback for incoming connections we suggest to change the listening port in case the shaping is done on a per-port basis.\r\nLevel 	Enabled 	Method 	allow outgoing fallback 	allow incoming fallback 	advantages 	disadvantages\r\n0 	No + using a non-standard port 	none 	Yes 	Yes 	Doesn''t use cryptography unless required by a peer1; no additional CPU consumption 	Doesn''t prevent traffic shaping, unless the provider simply throttles standard P2P ports\r\n1 	Yes 	Plain 	Yes 	Yes 	Least CPU intensive and most compatible setting to avoid traffic shaping 	Easy to detect since the payload isn''t encrypted\r\n2 	Yes 	RC4 	Yes 	Yes 	Still maintains maximum compatibility but avoids traffic shaping, at least for outgoing connections 	The incoming port used for BT connections may be detected\r\n3 2,3 	Yes 	RC4 	Yes 	No 	Prevents that any classic BT connection to the incoming port is successful and thus makes it harder to identify ports that are used for BT traffic 	Limited backwards compatibility\r\n4 3 	Yes 	RC4 	No 	No 	Prevents any classic BT connection and thus makes it harder to identify the entire host as a BT user 	No backwards compatibility at all\r\n5 3 	see Level 5 below\r\n[edit]\r\nLevel 5\r\n\r\n    Note: This is level is available from Azureus 3.0.2.3_B05 onwards. \r\n\r\nLevel 5 is only intended for people who have problems with a specific traffic shaping method employed by sandvine traffic shaping hardware, see Bad ISPs if this applies to you. The premise of this method is to minimize the amount of unencrypted information leaked. To enable it select following settings:\r\n\r\n   1. Tools -> Options -> Connection -> Transport Encryption\r\n          * Enable require encryption\r\n          * Select RC4\r\n          * Disable both fallback checkboxes \r\n   2. Tools -> Options -> Tracker -> Client\r\n          * Enable Do not announce the listening port to the tracker\r\n          * Set the peer limit to a low figure, start with 1 or 2\r\n          * set the Minimum time between tracker announces to 900 for example \r\n   3. Adjust DHT settings (2 mutually exclusive alternatives):\r\n          * Disable the DHT: \r\n\r\n              Go to Tools -> Options -> Plugins -> Distributed DB and uncheck Enable the distributed database \r\n\r\n          * Try to get more peers via DHT: \r\n\r\n              Go to Tools -> Options -> Plugins -> Distributed Tracker and uncheck Only track normal torrents[...] \r\n\r\n   4. Try to seed a torrent you haven''t seeded within the last few hours or so before applying these settings \r\n\r\n\r\n[edit]\r\nPossible problems\r\n\r\n    * For some of these settings to be available you will have to switch to intermediate or higher user mode\r\n    * This might not work on torrents with very few peers because the shaping device may grab all necessary data with the first few tracker announces\r\n    * These settings will significantly increase the time it takes to join a swarm, regardless of downloading or uploading, so you have to be patient and/or perform a manual announce a few(!) times until you get your first few pex-capable peers. You should also consider that PEX takes at least a minute, if not longer to gather additional peers.\r\n    * This will not work on private torrents, see below.\r\n    * This solution may not work at all for you! We''ve had both reports of success and failure with the method described above. \r\n\r\n[edit]\r\nPrivate torrents\r\n\r\nSince level 5 is highly dependent on PEX which is mutually exclusive with private torrents/trackers this mode cannot be applied to seed or download on private trackers. But since private trackers are usually community-based it should be easy for you to request your administrators to add HTTPS-support to their tracker and thus reduce the information leak to traffic shaping hardware.\r\n\r\n    Note: Since only users affected by this kind of traffic shaping will need https-tracker announces and the remaining userbase can use http the performance impact should be negligible. \r\n\r\n[edit]\r\nAlternatives\r\n\r\nIf you are not the initial seed of a torrent and just want to do your fair share of uploading you can do that while you''re still downloading by dynamically limiting the download speed to a multiple or fraction of the upload speed, you can do that by using autospeed classic under tools -> options -> transfer -> autospeed and setting an download to upload speed ratio.\r\n[edit]\r\nDisguising tracker traffic\r\n\r\nAnother option is to tunnel the tracker over TOR or an SSH-Tunnel via tracker communication proxying using SOCKS under tools -> options -> connection -> proxy options. If you do this you won''t have to set any of the above options (limiting peer requests etc.), but you will have to set your announce announce IP override to your external, public IP under tools -> options -> tracker -> client.\r\n[edit]\r\nNotes\r\n\r\n    * Note 1: Doesn''t work with private torrents\r\n    * Note 2: Should not be used in combination with the bind to local port feature\r\n    * Note 3: You should change your listening port and adjust your port forward and/or firewall rules after you''ve disabled incoming fallback connections \r\n\r\n[edit]\r\nSee also\r\n\r\n    * Message Stream Encryption\r\n    * Bad ISPs ', 1, 0, NULL, NULL);
INSERT INTO `wiki` VALUES (37, 'Message Stream Encryption', 'Message Stream Encryption\r\nFrom AzureusWiki\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: This is the Message Stream Encryption specification, see Avoid traffic shaping for Azureus specific setup instructions and documentation.\r\n\r\nProtocol Objectives\r\n\r\nThe following encapsulation protocol is designed to provide a completely random-looking header and (optionally) payload to avoid passive protocol identification and traffic shaping. When it is used with the stronger encryption mode (RC4) it also provides reasonable security for the encapsulated content against passive eavesdroppers.\r\n\r\nIt is a 3-way handshake where the initiating client can directly append its payload after his 2nd step (which globally is the 3rd). The responding client has to send one step (globally the 2nd) of the handshake and then wait until the initiating client has completed its 2nd step to send payload.\r\n\r\nTo achieve complete randomness from the first byte on the protocol uses a D-H key exchange which uses large random Integers by design. The 2nd phase - the payload encryption negotiation - is itself encrypted and thus approximately random too. To avoid simple length-pattern detections various paddings have been added to each phase.\r\n\r\nThis encapsulation protocol is independent of the encapsulated content, but is intended to be used with the BitTorrent Protocol, the Azureus messaging protocol (running ontop of the former) or the Enhanced messaging protocol in the near future. Since there are no guarantees about the content additional protocol detection is mandatory when the first payload arrives.\r\n\r\nThe 2 different payload encryption methods plaintext transmission and RC4 provide a different degree of protocol obfuscation, security and speed. Where the plaintext mode only provides basic anti-shaping obscurity, no security and low CPU usage the RC4 encryption obfuscates the entire stream and not only the header and adds some cryptographic security at the price of spent CPU cycles.\r\n\r\nIt is worth restating the aim - that of message stream obfuscation by the application of fairly simple cryptographic techniques, not a full blown transport level security mechanism like SSL. In the future, if the latter is required, this will be addressed by a separate activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n    * 1 Protocol Objectives\r\n    * 2 Message Stream Encryption (aka PHE) format specification\r\n    * 3 Implementation Notes for BitTorrent Clients\r\n    * 4 Tracker Extension\r\n    * 5 Notes about the current Azureus implementation\r\n    * 6 See also\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMessage Stream Encryption (aka PHE) format specification\r\nVersion 1.0\r\nAs of now the specification is frozen.

Thus it does not offer\r\nprotection against adversaries which already know the necessary data to establish\r\nconnections (that is IP/Port/Shared Secret/Payload protocol).\r\n\r\nTo minimize the load on systems that employ this protocol fast cryptographic\r\nmethods have been chosen over maximum-security algorithms.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n- Declarations -\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nThe entire handshake is in big-endian.\r\nThe crypto handshake is transparent to the next upper protocol,\r\nthus the payload endianness doesn''t matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nA is the initiator of the underlying transport (e.g. a TCP connection)\r\nB is the receiver\r\n\r\n##### DH Parameters\r\n\r\nPrime P is a 768 bit safe prime, "0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFC90FDAA22168C234C4C6628B80DC1CD129024E088A67CC74020BBEA63B139B22514A08798E3404DDEF9519B3CD3A431B302B0A6DF25F14374FE1356D6D51C245E485B576625E7EC6F44C42E9A63A36210000000000090563"\r\nGenerator G is "2"\r\n\r\nXa and Xb are a variable size random integers. \r\nThey are the private key for each side and have to be discarded after\r\nthe DH handshake is done. Minimum length is 128 bit. Anything beyond 180 bit\r\nis not believed to add any further security and only increases the necessary\r\ncalculation time. You should use a length of 160bits whenever possible, lower\r\nvalues may be used when CPU time is scarce.\r\n\r\nPubkey of A: Ya = (G^Xa) mod P\r\nPubkey of B: Yb = (G^Xb) mod P\r\n\r\nDH secret: S = (Ya^Xb) mod P = (Yb^Xa) mod P\r\n\r\nP, S, Ya and Yb are 768bits long\r\n\r\n##### Constants/Variables\r\n\r\n\r\nPadA, PadB: Random data with a random length of 0 to 512 bytes each\r\n\r\nPadC, PadD: Arbitrary data with a length of 0 to 512 bytes, can be\r\nused to extend the crypto handshake in future versions.\r\nCurrent implementations may choose to set them to 0-length.\r\nFor padding-only usage in the current version they should be zeroed.\r\n\r\n\r\nVC is a verification constant that is used to verify whether the other\r\nside knows S and SKEY and thus defeats replay attacks of the SKEY hash.\r\nAs of this version VC is a String of 8 bytes set to 0x00.\r\n\r\n\r\ncrypto_provide and crypto_select are a 32bit bitfields.\r\nAs of now 0x01 means plaintext, 0x02 means RC4. (see Functions)\r\nThe remaining bits are reserved for future use.\r\n\r\nThe initiating peer A should provide all methods he supports in the bitfield,\r\nbut he may choose only to provide higher encryption levels e.g. if  plaintext\r\nisn''t sufficient for it''s security needs.\r\nThe responding peer B should set a bit corresponding to the single method\r\nwhich he selected from the provided ones.\r\n\r\nBits with an unknown meaning in crypto_provide and crypto_select\r\nshould be ignored as they might be used in future versions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSKEY = Stream Identifier/Shared secret used to drop connections early if we\r\ndon''t have a matching stream. It''s additionally used to harden the protocol\r\nagainst MITM attacks and portscanning.\r\nProtocols w/o unique stream properties may use a constant.\r\n Note: For BitTorrent, the SKEY should be the torrent info hash.\r\n\r\n\r\nIA = initial payload data from A\r\nmay be 0-sized if you want to wait for the encryption negotation.\r\n\r\nPeer A may buffer up to 65535 bytes before or during the DH handshake to append\r\nit to the 3rd step. IA is considered as atomic and thus an implementation may\r\nnot expect that anything is handed to the upper layer before IA is completely\r\ntransmitted. Thus there must be no blocking operations within IA.\r\n\r\nNote, Example for Bittorrent:\r\n After \\19Bittorrent protocol + the BT handshake a block occurs since A waits\r\n for B to send his handshake before A continues to send his bitfield,\r\n thus IA can only include the prefix + the bt handshake but not the bitfield\r\n\r\n\r\n###### Functions\r\n\r\nlen(X) specifies the length of X in 2 bytes.\r\nThus the maximum length that can be specified is 65535 bytes, this is\r\nimportant for the IA block.\r\n\r\n\r\nENCRYPT() is RC4, that uses one of the following keys to send data:\r\n"HASH(''keyA'', S, SKEY)" if you''re A\r\n"HASH(''keyB'', S, SKEY)" if you''re B\r\nThe first 1024 bytes of the RC4 output are discarded.\r\nconsecutive calls to ENCRYPT() by one side continue the encryption\r\nstream (no reinitialization, no keychange). They are only used to distinguish\r\nsemantically seperate content. \r\n\r\n\r\nENCRYPT2() is the negotiated crypto method.\r\nCurrent options are:\r\n 0x01 Plaintext. After the specified length (see IA/IB) each side sends unencrypted payload\r\n 0x02 RC4-160. The ENCRYPT() RC4 encoding is continued (no reinitialization, no keychange)\r\n\r\n\r\nHASH() is SHA1 binary output (20 bytes)\r\n\r\n\r\n###### The handshake "packet" format\r\n\r\n\r\nThe handshake is seperated into 5 blocking steps.\r\n\r\n1 A->B: Diffie Hellman Ya, PadA\r\n2 B->A: Diffie Hellman Yb, PadB\r\n3 A->B: HASH(''req1'', S), HASH(''req2'', SKEY) xor HASH(''req3'', S), ENCRYPT(VC, crypto_provide, len(PadC), PadC, len(IA)), ENCRYPT(IA)\r\n4 B->A: ENCRYPT(VC, crypto_select, len(padD), padD), ENCRYPT2(Payload Stream)\r\n5 A->B: ENCRYPT2(Payload Stream)\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the length of PadA and PadB are unknown\r\nB will be able to resynchronize on HASH(''req1'', S)\r\nA will be able to resynchronize on ENCRYPT(VC)\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Optional early termination conditions\r\n(should verified before the indicated step is started).\r\n\r\nIf a fail-fast behavior is prefered the following conditions can be used to\r\ndisconnect the peer immediately. If less recognizable patterns are preferred\r\na peer may wait and disconnect at a later point. If any of these conditions\r\nare met the handshake can be considered as invalid.\r\n\r\n2 (termination by B)\r\nif A sent less than 96 Bytes within 30 seconds\r\nif A sent more than 608 bytes \r\n\r\n3 (termination by A)\r\nif B sent less than 96 Bytes within 30 seconds\r\nif B sent more than 608 bytes\r\n\r\n4 (termination by B)\r\nif A didn''t send the correct S hash within 628 bytes after the connection start (synchronisation point)\r\nif A didn''t send a supported SKEY hash after the S hash\r\nif VC can''t be decoded correctly after the SKEY hash\r\nif none of the crypto_provide options are supported or the bitfield is zeroed\r\nfrom here on it''s up to the next protocol layer to terminate the connection\r\n\r\n5 (termination by A)\r\nif VC can''t be decoded correctly within 616 bytes after the connection start (synchronisation point)\r\nif the selected crypto method wasn''t provided\r\nfrom here on it''s up to the next protocol layer to terminate the connection\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImplementation Notes for BitTorrent Clients\r\n\r\nSince not all BT clients will support this protocol there are 3 possible modes of operation:\r\n\r\n   1. Support incoming connections with the Obfuscation Header and legacy BT headers but always try establish classic BT streams for outgoing connections\r\n\r\n          This method ensures compatibility but only allows incoming obfuscated connections from traffic-shaped peers, obfuscated connections are never established to them, leading to a similar situation as if the shaped client was firewalled or NATed. \r\n\r\n   2. Support incoming connections for both protocols but try to establish connections with the Obfuscation Header first and retry with BT headers if that fails\r\n\r\n          Compatibility is still ensured and allows obfuscated connections to shaped peers but might not be suitable for shaped peers and requires reconnect attempts when an obfuscated handshake fails for any reason. \r\n\r\n   3. Only support obfuscated streams and treat any incoming connection like a DH key exchange attempt.\r\n\r\n          This method doesn''t provide backwards compatibility but ensures obfuscation. The CPU load can still be adjusted by choosing and providing different encryption methods \r\n\r\nAny peer A in mode #1 or #2 should avoid unneccessary non-crypto connections to a peer B that uses crypto-only (mode #3) whenever possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nTracker Extension\r\n\r\nA client may append the following parameters to a HTTP GET:\r\n\r\n    * supportcrypto=1 which means a peer can create and recieve crypto connections\r\n    * requirecrypto=1 which means a peer only accepts/creates crypto connections\r\n    * cryptoport=X in combination with port=0 which tells the tracker the port X on which the client is listening on as usual, but prevents the tracker from handing out a valid IP/Port combination if he doesn''t support the crypto extension. This is only valid in combination with requirecrypto=1. cryptoport is not mandatory, a client may choose to use the port parameter as usual if it accepts legacy connections as a fallback measure. \r\n\r\nA tracker response when neither flag is set: The tracker will return IPs/Ports as usual but omit peers that signaled requirecrypto\r\n\r\nA tracker response when the supportcrypto flag is set: In addition to the normal peers list (or string in the compact=1 case) an additional crypto_flags string which contains a bytearray in the same order as the peers list is sent. 1 means the corresponding peer requires crypto connections 0 means the peer supports and prefers classic BT\r\n\r\nA tracker response when the requirecrypto flag is set: In addition to the normal peers list (or string in the compact=1 case) an additional crypto_flags string which contains a bytearray in the same order as the peers list is sent. 1 means the corresponding peer requires crypto connections 0 means the peer supports and prefers classic BT. The tracker should try to achieve the numwant limit with peers that flagged requirecrypto or supportcrypto first and only add non-supporting peers if no others are available.\r\n\r\nAzureus supports this from 2403 B55+.\r\n\r\nNotes about the current Azureus implementation\r\n\r\nAzureus tries to avoid unnecessary non-crypto connections through obfuscation-header aware Peer Exchanges, advanced messaging handshakes and Distributed tracker announces. Peer A tells its preferred connection mode in the handshake to peer B and then B adds additional flags to the PEX messages when it propagates A''s address/port. This does not work in combination with Secure Torrents since they disable PEX and the DHT.\r\n\r\nAzureus currently allows its users either to specify fallback support for incoming and outgoing connections seperately when the encryption is enabled or passive support only instead. Specified encryption methods aren''t preferences but minimum requirements, for both incoming and outgoing connections, i.e. if a peer doesn''t support the minimum (or possibly higher levels in the future) then the connection will can''t be established. And Azureus will only offer minimum or higher level methods. ', 1, 0, NULL, NULL);

Visit his pages at http://www.bittorrent.com BitTorrent is designed to facilitate file transfers among multiple peers across unreliable networks.\r\nPurpose\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this specification is to document version 1.0 of the BitTorrent protocol specification in detail. Bram''s protocol specification page outlines the protocol in somewhat general terms, and lacks behaviorial detail in some areas. The hope is that this document will become a formal specification, written in clear, unambiguous terms, which can be used as a basis for discussion and implementation in the future.\r\n\r\nThis document is intended to be maintained and used by the BitTorrent development community. Everyone is invited to contribute to this document, with the understanding that the content here is intended to represent the current protocol, which is already deployed in a number of existing client implementations.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to suggest feature requests. For that, please go to the mailing list.\r\nScope\r\n\r\nThis document applies to the first version (i.e. version 1.0) of the BitTorrent protocol specification. Currently, this applies to the torrent file structure, peer wire protocol, and the Tracker HTTP/HTTPS protocol specifications. As newer revisions of each protocol are defined, they should be specified on their own separate pages, not here.\r\nRelated Documents\r\n\r\n    * Official protocol specification\r\n    * Developer and user wishlist\r\n    * Tracker protocol extensions \r\n\r\nConventions\r\n\r\nIn this document, a number of conventions are used in an attempt to present information in a concise and unambiguous fashion.\r\n\r\n    * peer v/s client: In this document, a peer is any BitTorrent client participating in a download. The client is also a peer, however it is the BitTorrent client that is running on the local machine. Readers of this specification may choose to think of themselves as the client which connects to numerous peers.\r\n    * piece v/s block: In this document, a piece refers to a portion of the downloaded data that is described in the metainfo file, which can be verified by a SHA1 hash. A block is a portion of data that a client may request from a peer. Two or more blocks make up a whole piece, which may then be verified.\r\n    * defacto standard: Large blocks of text in italics indicates a practice so common in various client implementations of BitTorrent that it is considered a defacto standard. \r\n\r\nIn order to help others find recent changes that have been made to this document, please fill out the change log (last section). This should contain a brief (i.e. one-line) entry for each major change that you''ve made to the document.\r\nbencoding\r\n\r\nBencoding is a way to specify and organize data in a terse format. It supports the following types: byte strings, integers, lists, and dictionaries.\r\nbyte strings\r\n\r\nByte strings are encoded as follows: <string length encoded in base ten ASCII>:<string data>\r\nNote that there is no constant beginning delimiter, and no ending delimiter.\r\n\r\n    Example: 4:spam represents the string "spam" \r\n\r\nintegers\r\n\r\nIntegers are encoded as follows: i<integer encoded in base ten ASCII>e\r\nThe initial i and trailing e are beginning and ending delimiters. You can have negative numbers such as i-3e. You cannot prefix the number with a zero such as i04e. However, i0e is valid.\r\n\r\n    Example: i3e represents the integer "3" \r\n\r\n    * NOTE: The maximum number of bit of this integer is unspecified, but to handle it as a signed 64bit integer is mandatory to handle "large files" aka .torrent for more that 4Gbyte \r\n\r\nlists\r\n\r\nLists are encoded as follows: l<bencoded values>e\r\nThe initial l and trailing e are beginning and ending delimiters. Lists may contain any bencoded type, including integers, strings, dictionaries, and other lists.\r\n\r\n    Example: l4:spam4:eggse represents the list of two strings: [ "spam", "eggs" ] \r\n\r\ndictionaries\r\n\r\nDictionaries are encoded as follows: d<bencoded string><bencoded element>e\r\nThe initial d and trailing e are the beginning and ending delimiters. Note that the keys must be bencoded strings. The values may be any bencoded type, including integers, strings, lists, and other dictionaries. Keys must be strings and appear in sorted order (sorted as raw strings, not alphanumerics). The strings should be compared using a binary comparison, not a culture-specific "natural" comparison.\r\n\r\n    Example: d3:cow3:moo4:spam4:eggse represents the dictionary { "cow" => "moo", "spam" => "eggs" }\r\n    Example: d4:spaml1:a1:bee represents the dictionary { "spam" => [ "a", "b" ] }\r\n    Example: d9:publisher3:bob17:publisher-webpage15:www.example.com18:publisher.location4:homee represents { "publisher" => "bob", "publisher-webpage" => "www.example.com", "publisher.location" => "home" } \r\n\r\nImplementations\r\n\r\n    * C\r\n    * Perl\r\n    * Java\r\n    * Python by Hackeron\r\n    * Decoding encoding bencoded data with haskell by Edi\r\n    * Objective-C by Chrome \r\n\r\nMetainfo File Structure\r\n\r\nAll data in a metainfo file is bencoded. The specification for bencoding is defined above.\r\n\r\nThe content of a metainfo file (the file ending in ".torrent") is a bencoded dictionary, containing the keys listed below. All character string values are UTF-8 encoded.\r\n\r\n    * info: a dictionary that describes the file(s) of the torrent. There are two possible forms: one for the case of a ''single-file'' torrent with no directory structure, and one for the case of a ''multi-file'' torrent (see below for details)\r\n    * announce: The announce URL of the tracker (string)\r\n    * announce-list: (optional) this is an extention to the official specification, offering backwards-compatibility. (list of lists of strings).\r\n          o The official request for a specification change is here. \r\n    * creation date: (optional) the creation time of the torrent, in standard UNIX epoch format (integer, seconds since 1-Jan-1970 00:00:00 UTC)\r\n    * comment: (optional) free-form textual comments of the author (string)\r\n    * created by: (optional) name and version of the program used to create the .torrent (string) \r\n\r\nInfo Dictionary\r\n\r\nThis section contains the field which are common to both mode, "single file" and "multiple file".\r\n\r\n    * piece length: number of bytes in each piece (integer)\r\n    * pieces: string consisting of the concatenation of all 20-byte SHA1 hash values, one per piece (byte string, i.e. not urlencoded)\r\n    * private: (optional) this field is an integer. If it is set to "1", the client MUST publish its presence to get other peers ONLY via the trackers explicitly described in the metainfo file. If this field is set to "0" or is not present, the client may obtain peer from other means, e.g. PEX peer exchange, dht. Here, "private" may be read as "no external peer source".\r\n          o NOTE: There is much debate surrounding private trackers.\r\n          o The official request for a specification change is here.\r\n          o Azureus was the first client to respect private trackers, see their wiki for more details. \r\n\r\nInfo in Single File Mode\r\n\r\nFor the case of the single-file mode, the info dictionary contains the following structure:\r\n\r\n    * name: the filename. This is purely advisory. (string)\r\n    * length: length of the file in bytes (integer)\r\n    * md5sum: (optional) a 32-character hexadecimal string corresponding to the MD5 sum of the file. This is not used by BitTorrent at all, but it is included by some programs for greater compatibility. \r\n\r\nInfo in Multiple File Mode\r\n\r\nFor the case of the multi-file mode, the info dictionary contains the following structure:\r\n\r\n    * name: the filename of the directory in which to store all the files. This is purely advisory. (string)\r\n    * files: a list of dictionaries, one for each file. Each dictionary in this list contains the following keys:\r\n          o length: length of the file in bytes (integer)\r\n          o md5sum: (optional) a 32-character hexadecimal string corresponding to the MD5 sum of the file. This is not used by BitTorrent at all, but it is included by some programs for greater compatibility.\r\n          o path: a list containing one or more string elements that together represent the path and filename. Each element in the list corresponds to either a directory name or (in the case of the final element) the filename. For example, a the file "dir1/dir2/file.ext" would consist of three string elements: "dir1", "dir2", and "file.ext". This is encoded as a bencoded list of strings such as l4:dir14:dir28:file.exte \r\n\r\nNotes\r\n\r\n    * The piece length specifies the nominal piece size, and is usually a power of 2. The piece size is typically chosen based on the total amount of file data in the torrent, and is constrained by the fact that too-large piece sizes cause inefficiency, and too-small piece sizes cause large .torrent metadata file. Historically, piece size was chosen to result in a .torrent file no greater than approx. 50 - 75 kB (presumably to ease the load on the server hosting the torrent files).\r\n          o Current best-practice is to keep the piece size to 512KB or less, for torrents around 8-10GB, even if that results in a larger .torrent file. This results in a more efficient swarm for sharing files. The most common sizes are 256 kB, 512 kB, and 1 MB.\r\n          o Every piece is of equal length except for the final piece, which is irregular. The number of pieces is thus determined by ''ceil( total length / piece size )''.\r\n          o For the purposes of piece boundaries in the multi-file case, consider the file data as one long continuous stream, composed of the concatenation of each file in the order listed in the files list. The number of pieces and their boundaries are then determined in the same manner as the case of a single file. Pieces may overlap file boundaries. \r\n    * Each piece has a corresponding SHA1 hash of the data contained within that piece. These hashes are concatenated to form the pieces value in the above info dictionary. Note that this is not a list but rather a single string. The length of the string must be a multiple of 20. \r\n\r\nTracker HTTP/HTTPS Protocol\r\n\r\nThe tracker is an HTTP/HTTPS service which responds to HTTP GET requests. The requests include metrics from clients that help the tracker keep overall statistics about the torrent. The response includes a peer list that helps the client participate in the torrent. The base URL consists of the "announce URL" as defined in the metadata (.torrent) file. The parameters are then added to this URL, using standard CGI methods (i.e. a ''?'' after the announce URL, followed by ''param=value'' sequences separated by ''&'').\r\n\r\nNote that all binary data in the URL (particularly info_hash and peer_id) must be properly escaped. This means any byte not in the set 0-9, a-z, A-Z, ''.'', ''-'', ''_'' and ''~'', must be encoded using the "%nn" format, where nn is the hexadecimal value of the byte. (See RFC1738 for details.)\r\n\r\nFor a 20-byte hash of \\x12\\x34\\x56\\x78\\x9a\\xbc\\xde\\xf1\\x23\\x45\\x67\\x89\\xab\\xcd\\xef\\x12\\x34\\x56\\x78\\x9a,\r\nThe right encoded form is %124Vx%9A%BC%DE%F1%23Eg%89%AB%CD%EF%124Vx%9A\r\nTracker Request Parameters\r\n\r\nThe parameters used in the client->tracker GET request are as follows:\r\n\r\n    * info_hash: urlencoded 20-byte SHA1 hash of the value of the info key from the Metainfo file. Note that the value will be a bencoded dictionary, given the definition of the info key above.\r\n    * peer_id: urlencoded 20-byte string used as a unique ID for the client, generated by the client at startup. This is allowed to be any value, and may be binary data. There are currently no guidelines for generating this peer ID. However, one may rightly presume that it must at least be unique for your local machine, thus should probably incorporate things like process ID and perhaps a timestamp recorded at startup. See peer_id below for common client encodings of this field.\r\n    * port: The port number that the client is listening on. Ports reserved for BitTorrent are typically 6881-6889. Clients may choose to give up if it cannot establish a port within this range.\r\n    * uploaded: The total amount uploaded (since the client sent the ''started'' event to the tracker) in base ten ASCII. While not explicitly stated in the official specification, the concensus is that this should be the total number of bytes uploaded.\r\n    * downloaded: The total amount downloaded (since the client sent the ''started'' event to the tracker) in base ten ASCII. While not explicitly stated in the official specification, the consensus is that this should be the total number of bytes downloaded.\r\n    * left: The number of bytes this client still has to download, encoded in base ten ASCII.\r\n    * compact: Setting this to 1 indicates that the client accepts a compact response. The peers list is replaced by a peers string with 6 bytes per peer. The first four bytes are the host (in network byte order), the last two bytes are the port (again in network byte order). It should be noted that some trackers only support compact responses (for saving bandwidth) and either refuse requests without "compact=1" or simply send a compact response unless the request contains "compact=0" (in which case they will refuse the request.)\r\n    * no_peer_id: Indicates that the tracker can omit peer id field in peers dictionary. This option is ignored if compact is enabled.\r\n    * event: If specified, must be one of started, completed, stopped, (or empty which is the same as not being specified). If not specified, then this request is one performed at regular intervals.\r\n          o started: The first request to the tracker must include the event key with this value.\r\n          o stopped: Must be sent to the tracker if the client is shutting down gracefully.\r\n          o completed: Must be sent to the tracker when the download completes. However, must not be sent if the download was already 100% complete when the client started. Presumably, this is to allow the tracker to increment the "completed downloads" metric based soley on this event. \r\n    * ip: Optional. The true IP address of the client machine, in dotted quad format or rfc3513 defined hexed IPv6 address. Notes: In general this parameter is not necessary as the address of the client can be determined from the IP address from which the HTTP request came. The parameter is only needed in the case where the IP address that the request came in on is not the IP address of the client. This happens if the client is communicating to the tracker through a proxy (or a transparent web proxy/cache.) It also is necessary when both the client and the tracker are on the same local side of a NAT gateway. The reason for this is that otherwise the tracker would give out the internal (RFC1918) address of the client, which is not routeable. Therefore the client must explicitly state its (external, routeable) IP address to be given out to external peers. Various trackers treat this parameter differently. Some only honor it only if the IP address that the request came in on is in RFC1918 space. Others honor it unconditionally, while others ignore it completely. In case of IPv6 address (e.g.: 2001:db8:1:2::100) it indicates only that client can communicate via IPv6.\r\n    * numwant: Optional. Number of peers that the client would like to receive from the tracker. This value is permitted to be zero. If omitted, typically defaults to 50 peers.\r\n    * key: Optional. An additional identification that is not shared with any users. It is intended to allow a client to prove their identity should their IP address change.\r\n    * trackerid: Optional. If a previous announce contained a tracker id, it should be set here. \r\n\r\nTracker Response\r\n\r\nThe tracker responds with "text/plain" document consisting of a bencoded dictionary with the following keys:\r\n\r\n    * failure reason: If present, then no other keys may be present. The value is a human-readable error message as to why the request failed (string).\r\n    * warning message: (new, optional) Similar to failure reason, but the response still gets processed normally. The warning message is shown just like an error.\r\n    * interval: Interval in seconds that the client should wait between sending regular requests to the tracker\r\n    * min interval: (optional) Minimum announce interval. If present clients must not reannounce more frequently than this.\r\n    * tracker id: A string that the client should send back on its next announcements. If absent and a previous announce sent a tracker id, do not discard the old value; keep using it.\r\n    * complete: number of peers with the entire file, i.e. seeders (integer)\r\n    * incomplete: number of non-seeder peers, aka "leechers" (integer)\r\n    * peers: (dictionary model) The value is a list of dictionaries, each with the following keys:\r\n          o peer id: peer''s self-selected ID, as described above for the tracker request (string)\r\n          o ip: peer''s IP address either IPv6 (hexed) or IPv4 (dotted quad) or DNS name (string)\r\n          o port: peer''s port number (integer) \r\n    * peers: (binary model) Instead of using the dictionary model described above, the peers value may be a string consisting of multiples of 6 bytes. First 4 bytes are the IP address and last 2 bytes are the port number. All in network (big endian) notation. \r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, the list of peers is length 50 by default. If there are fewer peers in the torrent, then the list will be smaller. Otherwise, the tracker randomly selects peers to include in the response. The tracker may choose to implement a more intelligent mechanism for peer selection when responding to a request. For instance, reporting seeds to other seeders could be avoided.\r\n\r\nClients may send a request to the tracker more often than the specified interval, if an event occurs (i.e. stopped or completed) or if the client needs to learn about more peers. However, it is considered bad practice to "hammer" on a tracker to get multiple peers. If a client wants a large peer list in the response, then it should specify the numwant parameter.\r\n\r\nImplementer''s Note: Even 30 peers is plenty, the official client version 3 in fact only actively forms new connections if it has less than 30 peers and will refuse connections if it has 55. This value is important to performance. When a new piece has completed download, HAVE messages (see below) will need to be sent to most active peers. As a result the cost of broadcast traffic grows in direct proportion to the number of peers. Above 25, new peers are highly unlikely to increase download speed. UI designers are strongly advised to make this obscure and hard to change as it is very rare to be useful to do so.\r\nTracker ''scrape'' Convention\r\n\r\nBy convention most trackers support another form of request, which queries the state of a given torrent (or all torrents) that the tracker is managing. This is referred to as the "scrape page" because it automates the otherwise tedious process of "screen scraping" the tracker''s stats page.\r\n\r\nThe scrape URL is also a HTTP GET method, similar to the one described above. However the base URL is different. To derive the scrape URL use the following steps: Begin with the announce URL. Find the last ''/'' in it. If the text immediately following that ''/'' isn''t ''announce'' it will be taken as a sign that that tracker doesn''t support the scrape convention. If it does, substitute ''scrape'' for ''announce'' to find the scrape page.\r\n\r\nExamples: (announce URL -> scrape URL)\r\n\r\n  ~http://example.com/announce          -> ~http://example.com/scrape\r\n  ~http://example.com/x/announce        -> ~http://example.com/x/scrape\r\n  ~http://example.com/announce.php      -> ~http://example.com/scrape.php\r\n  ~http://example.com/a                 -> (scrape not supported)\r\n  ~http://example.com/announce?x2%0644 -> ~http://example.com/scrape?x2%0644\r\n  ~http://example.com/announce?x=2/4    -> (scrape not supported)\r\n  ~http://example.com/x%064announce     -> (scrape not supported)\r\n\r\nNote especially that entity unquoting is not to be done. This standard is documented by Bram in the BitTorrent development list archive: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/BitTorrent/message/3275\r\n\r\nThe scrape URL may be supplemented by the optional parameter info_hash, a 20-byte value as described above. This restricts the tracker''s report to that particular torrent. Otherwise stats for all torrents that the tracker is managing are returned. Software authors are strongly encouraged to use the info_hash parameter when at all possible, to reduce the load and bandwidth of the tracker.\r\n\r\nYou may also specify multiple info_hash parameters to trackers that support it. While this isn''t part of the official specifications it has become somewhat a defacto standard - for example:\r\n\r\n http://example.com/scrape.php?info_hash=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa&info_hash=bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb&info_hash=cccccccccccccccccccc\r\n\r\nThe response of this HTTP GET method is a "text/plain" or sometimes gzip compressed document consisting of a bencoded dictionary, containing the following keys:\r\n\r\n    * files: a dictionary containing one key/value pair for each torrent for which there are stats. If info_hash was supplied and was valid, this dictionary will contain a single key/value. Each key consists of a 20-byte binary info_hash. The value of each entry is another dictionary containing the following:\r\n          o complete: number of peers with the entire file, i.e. seeders (integer)\r\n          o downloaded: total number of times the tracker has registered a completion ("event=complete", i.e. a client finished downloading the torrent)\r\n          o incomplete: number of non-seeder peers, aka "leechers" (integer)\r\n          o name: (optional) the torrent''s internal name, as specified by the "name" file in the info section of the .torrent file \r\n\r\nNote that this response has three levels of dictionary nesting. Here''s an example:\r\n\r\nd5:filesd20:....................d8:completei5e10:downloadedi50e10:incompletei10eeee\r\n\r\nWhere .................... is the 20 byte info_hash and there are 5 seeders, 10 leechers, and 50 complete downloads.\r\nUnofficial extensions to scrape\r\n\r\nBelow are the response keys are being unofficially used. Since they are unofficial, they are all optional.\r\n\r\n    * failure reason: Human-readable error message as to why the request failed (string). Clients known to handle this key: Azureus.\r\n    * flags: a dictionary containing miscellaneous flags. The value of the flags key is another nested dictionary, possibly containing the following:\r\n          o min_request_interval: The value for this key is an integer specifying how the minimum number of seconds for the client to wait before scraping the tracker again. Trackers known to send this key: BNBT. Clients known to handle this key: Azureus. \r\n\r\nPeer wire protocol (TCP)\r\nOverview\r\n\r\nThe peer protocol facilitates the exchange of pieces as described in the ''metainfo file.\r\n\r\nNote here that the original specification also used the term "piece" when describing the peer protocol, but as a different term than "piece" in the metainfo file. For that reason, the term "block" will be used in this specification to describe the data that is exchanged between peers over the wire.\r\n\r\nA client must maintain state information for each connection that it has with a remote peer:\r\n\r\n    * choked: Whether or not the remote peer has choked this client. When a peer chokes the client, it is a notification that no requests will be answered until the client is unchoked. The client should not attempt to send requests for blocks, and it should consider all pending (unanswered) requests to be discarded by the remote peer.\r\n    * interested: Whether or not the remote peer is interested in something this client has to offer. This is a notification that the remote peer will begin requesting blocks when the client unchokes them. \r\n\r\nNote that this also implies that the client will also need to keep track of whether or not it is interested in the remote peer, and if it has the remote peer choked or unchoked. So, the real list looks something like this:\r\n\r\n    * am_choking: this client is choking the peer\r\n    * am_interested: this client is interested in the peer\r\n    * peer_choking: peer is choking this client\r\n    * peer_interested: peer is interested in this client \r\n\r\nClient connections start out as "choked" and "not interested". In other words:\r\n\r\n    * am_choking = 1\r\n    * am_interested = 0\r\n    * peer_choking = 1\r\n    * peer_interested = 0 \r\n\r\nA block is downloaded by the client when the client is interested in a peer, and that peer is not choking the client. A block is uploaded by a client when the client is not choking a peer, and that peer is interested in the client.\r\n\r\nIt is important for the client to keep its peers informed as to whether or not it is interested in them. This state information should be kept up-to-date with each peer even when the client is choked. This will allow peers to know if the client will begin downloading when it is unchoked (and vice-versa).\r\nData Types\r\n\r\nUnless specified otherwise, all integers in the peer wire protocol are encoded as four byte big-endian values. This includes the length prefix on all messages that come after the handshake.\r\nMessage flow\r\n\r\nThe peer wire protocol consists of an initial handshake. After that, peers communicate via an exchange of length-prefixed messages. The length-prefix is an integer as described above.\r\nHandshake\r\n\r\nThe handshake is a required message and must be the first message transmitted by the client. It is (49+len(pstr)) bytes long.\r\n\r\nhandshake: <pstrlen><pstr><reserved><info_hash><peer_id>\r\n\r\n    * pstrlen: string length of <pstr>, as a single raw byte\r\n    * pstr: string identifier of the protocol\r\n    * reserved: eight (8) reserved bytes. All current implementations use all zeroes. Each bit in these bytes can be used to change the behavior of the protocol. An email from Bram suggests that trailing bits should be used first, so that leading bits may be used to change the meaning of trailing bits.\r\n    * info_hash: 20-byte SHA1 hash of the info key in the metainfo file. This is the same info_hash that is transmitted in tracker requests.\r\n    * peer_id: 20-byte string used as a unique ID for the client. This is usually the same peer_id that is transmitted in tracker requests (but not always e.g. an anonymity option in Azureus). \r\n\r\nIn version 1.0 of the BitTorrent protocol, pstrlen = 19, and pstr = "BitTorrent protocol".\r\n\r\nThe initiator of a connection is expected to transmit their handshake immediately. The recipient may wait for the initiator''s handshake, if it is capable of serving multiple torrents simultaneously (torrents are uniquely identified by their infohash). However, the recipient must respond as soon as it sees the info_hash part of the handshake. The tracker''s NAT-checking feature does not send the peer_id field of the handshake.\r\n\r\nIf a client receives a handshake with an info_hash that it is not currently serving, then the client must drop the connection.\r\n\r\nIf the initiator of the connection receives a handshake in which the peer_id does not match the expected peerid, then the initiator is expected to drop the connection. Note that the initiator presumably received the peer information from the tracker, which includes the peer_id that was registered by the peer. The peer_id from the tracker and in the handshake are expected to match.\r\npeer_id\r\n\r\nThe peer_id is exactly 20 bytes (characters) long.\r\n\r\nThere are mainly two conventions how to encode client and client version information into the peer_id, Azureus-style and Shadow''s-style.\r\n\r\nAzureus-style uses the following encoding: ''-'', two characters for client id, four ascii digits for version number, ''-'', followed by random numbers.\r\n\r\nFor example: ''-AZ2060-''...\r\n\r\nknown clients that uses this encoding style are:\r\n\r\n    * ''AG'' - Ares\r\n    * ''A~'' - Ares\r\n    * ''AR'' - Arctic\r\n    * ''AT'' - Artemis\r\n    * ''AX'' - BitPump\r\n    * ''AZ'' - Azureus\r\n    * ''BB'' - BitBuddy\r\n    * ''BC'' - BitComet\r\n    * ''BF'' - Bitflu\r\n    * ''BG'' - BTG (uses Rasterbar libtorrent)\r\n    * ''BP'' - BitTorrent Pro (Azureus + spyware)\r\n    * ''BR'' - BitRocket\r\n    * ''BS'' - BTSlave\r\n    * ''BW'' - BitWombat\r\n    * ''BX'' - ~Bittorrent X\r\n    * ''CD'' - Enhanced CTorrent\r\n    * ''CT'' - CTorrent\r\n    * ''DE'' - DelugeTorrent\r\n    * ''DP'' - Propagate Data Client\r\n    * ''EB'' - EBit\r\n    * ''ES'' - electric sheep\r\n    * ''FC'' - FileCroc\r\n    * ''FT'' - FoxTorrent\r\n    * ''GS'' - GSTorrent\r\n    * ''HL'' - Halite\r\n    * ''HN'' - Hydranode\r\n    * ''KG'' - KGet\r\n    * ''KT'' - KTorrent\r\n    * ''LC'' - LeechCraft\r\n    * ''LH'' - LH-ABC\r\n    * ''LP'' - Lphant\r\n    * ''LT'' - libtorrent\r\n    * ''lt'' - libTorrent\r\n    * ''LW'' - LimeWire\r\n    * ''MO'' - MonoTorrent\r\n    * ''MP'' - MooPolice\r\n    * ''MR'' - Miro\r\n    * ''MT'' - MoonlightTorrent\r\n    * ''NX'' - Net Transport\r\n    * ''OT'' - OmegaTorrent\r\n    * ''PD'' - Pando\r\n    * ''qB'' - qBittorrent\r\n    * ''QD'' - QQDownload\r\n    * ''QT'' - Qt 4 Torrent example\r\n    * ''RT'' - Retriever\r\n    * ''S~'' - Shareaza alpha/beta\r\n    * ''SB'' - ~Swiftbit\r\n    * ''SS'' - SwarmScope\r\n    * ''ST'' - SymTorrent\r\n    * ''st'' - sharktorrent\r\n    * ''SZ'' - Shareaza\r\n    * ''TN'' - TorrentDotNET\r\n    * ''TR'' - Transmission\r\n    * ''TS'' - Torrentstorm\r\n    * ''TT'' - TuoTu\r\n    * ''UL'' - uLeecher!\r\n    * ''UT'' - ?Torrent\r\n    * ''VG'' - Vagaa\r\n    * ''WT'' - BitLet\r\n    * ''WY'' - FireTorrent\r\n    * ''XL'' - Xunlei\r\n    * ''XT'' - XanTorrent\r\n    * ''XX'' - Xtorrent\r\n    * ''ZT'' - ZipTorrent \r\n\r\nClients which have been seen in the wild and need to be identified:\r\n\r\n    * ''BD'' (example: -BD0300-)\r\n    * ''NP'' (example: -NP0201-)\r\n    * ''SD'' (example: -SD0100-)\r\n    * ''wF'' (example: -wF2200-)\r\n    * ''hk'' (example: -hk0010-) Chinese IP address, unrequestedly sends info dict in message 0xA, reconnects immediately after being disconnected, reserved bytes = 01,01,01,01,00,00,02,01 \r\n\r\nShadow''s style uses the following encoding: one ascii alphanumeric for client identification, up to five characters for version number (padded with ''-'' if less than five), followed by three characters (commonly ''---'', but not always the case), followed by random characters. Each character in the version string represents a number from 0 to 63. ''0''=0, ..., ''9''=9, ''A''=10, ..., ''Z''=35, ''a''=36, ..., ''z''=61, ''.''=62, ''-''=63.\r\n\r\nA full explanation by Shad0w about the encoding style (including information about existing conventions on how the three characters after the version string are used) can be found here.\r\n\r\nFor example: ''S58B-----''... for Shadow''s 5.8.11\r\n\r\nknown clients that uses this encoding style are:\r\n\r\n    * ''A'' - ABC\r\n    * ''O'' - Osprey Permaseed\r\n    * ''Q'' - BTQueue\r\n    * ''R'' - Tribler\r\n    * ''S'' - Shadow''s client\r\n    * ''T'' - BitTornado\r\n    * ''U'' - UPnP NAT Bit Torrent \r\n\r\nBram''s client now uses this style... ''M3-4-2--'' or ''M4-20-8-''.\r\n\r\nBitComet does something different still. Its peer_id consists of four ASCII characters ''exbc'', followed by two bytes x and y, followed by random characters. The version number is x in decimal before the decimal point and y as two decimal digits after the decimal point. BitLord uses the same scheme, but adds ''LORD'' after the version bytes. An unofficial patch for BitComet once replaced ''exbc'' with ''FUTB''. The encoding for BitComet Peer IDs changed to Azureus-style as of BitComet version 0.59.\r\n\r\nXBT Client has its own style too. Its peer_id consists of the three uppercase characters ''XBT'' followed by three ASCII digits representing the version number. If the client is a debug build, the seventh byte is the lowercase character ''d'', otherwise it is a ''-''. Following that is a ''-'' then random digits, uppercase and lowercase letters. Example: ''XBT054d-'' at the beginning would indicate a debug build of version 0.5.4.\r\n\r\nOpera 8 previews and Opera 9.x releases use the following peer_id scheme: The first two characters are ''OP'' and the next four digits equal the build number. All following characters are random lowercase hexdecimal digits.\r\n\r\nMLdonkey use the following peer_id scheme: the first characters are ''-ML'' followed by a dotted version then a ''-'' followed by randomness. e.g. ''-ML2.7.2-kgjjfkd''\r\n\r\nBits on Wheels uses the pattern ''-BOWxxx-yyyyyyyyyyyy'', where y is random (uppercase letters) and x depends on the version. Version 1.0.6 has xxx = A0C.\r\n\r\nQueen Bee uses Bram''s new style: ''Q1-0-0--'' or ''Q1-10-0-'' followed by random bytes.\r\n\r\nBitTyrant is an Azureus fork and simply uses ''AZ2500BT'' + random bytes as peer ID in its 1.1 version. Note the missing dashes.\r\n\r\nTorrenTopia version 1.90 pretends to be or is derived from Mainline 3.4.6. Its peer ID starts with ''346------''.\r\n\r\nBitSpirit has several modes for its peer ID. In one mode it reads the ID of its peer and reconnects using the first eight bytes as a basis for its own ID. Its real ID appears to use ''\\0\\3BS'' (C notation) as the first four bytes for version 3.x and ''\\0\\2BS'' for version 2.x. In all modes the ID may end in ''UDP0''.\r\n\r\nRufus uses its version as decimal ASCII values for the first two bytes. The third and fourth bytes are ''RS''. What then follows is the nickname of the user and some random bytes.\r\n\r\nG3 Torrent starts its peer ID with ''-G3'' and appends up to 9 characters of the nickname of the user.\r\n\r\nFlashGet uses Azureus style with ''FG'' but without the trailing ''-''. Version 1.82.1002 still uses the version digits ''0180''.\r\n\r\nBT Next Evolution is derived from BitTornado but tries to mimic Azureus style. The result is that its peer ID starts with ''-NE'', continues with a 4 digit version number and then directly goes on with the three characters that describe the type of client in Shad0w''s peer ID style.\r\n\r\nAllPeers takes the sha1 hash of a user dependent string and replaces the first few characters with "AP" + version string + "-".\r\n\r\nQvod starts its id with the four letters "QVOD" and continues with its build number in four decimal digits (currently "0054"). The remaining 12 characters are random uppercase hexdecimal digits. There appears to be a popular modified client in China that replaces the four characters in the beginning with random bytes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany clients are using all random numbers or 12 zeroes followed by random numbers (like older versions of Bram''s client).\r\nMessages\r\n\r\nAll of the remaining messages in the protocol take the form of <length prefix><message ID><payload>. The length prefix is a four byte big-endian value. The message ID is a single decimal byte. The payload is message dependent.\r\nkeep-alive: <len=0000>\r\n\r\nThe keep-alive message is a message with zero bytes, specified with the length prefix set to zero. There is no message ID and no payload. Peers may close a connection if they receive no messages (keep-alive or any other message) for a certain period of time, so a keep-alive message must be sent to maintain the connection alive if no command have been sent for a given amount of time. This amount of time is generally two minutes.\r\nchoke: <len=0001><id=0>\r\n\r\nThe choke message is fixed-length and has no payload.\r\nunchoke: <len=0001><id=1>\r\n\r\nThe unchoke message is fixed-length and has no payload.\r\ninterested: <len=0001><id=2>\r\n\r\nThe interested message is fixed-length and has no payload.\r\nnot interested: <len=0001><id=3>\r\n\r\nThe not interested message is fixed-length and has no payload.\r\nhave: <len=0005><id=4><piece index>\r\n\r\nThe have message is fixed length. The payload is the zero-based index of a piece that has just been successfully downloaded and verified via the hash.\r\n\r\nImplementer''s Note: That is the strict definition, in reality some games may be played. In particular because peers are extremely unlikely to download pieces that they already have, a peer may choose not to advertise having a piece to a peer that already has that piece. At a minimum "HAVE supression" will result in a 50% reduction in the number of HAVE messages, this translates to around a 25-35% reduction in protocol overhead. At the same time, it may be worthwhile to send a HAVE message to a peer that has that piece already since it will be useful in determining which piece is rare.\r\n\r\nA malicious peer might also choose to advertise having pieces that it knows the peer will never download. Due to this attempting to model peers using this information is a bad idea.\r\nbitfield: <len=0001+X><id=5><bitfield>\r\n\r\nThe bitfield message may only be sent immediately after the handshaking sequence is completed, and before any other messages are sent. It is optional, and need not be sent if a client has no pieces.\r\n\r\nThe bitfield message is variable length, where X is the length of the bitfield. The payload is a bitfield representing the pieces that have been successfully downloaded. The high bit in the first byte corresponds to piece index 0. Bits that are cleared indicated a missing piece, and set bits indicate a valid and available piece. Spare bits at the end are set to zero.\r\n\r\nA bitfield of the wrong length is considered an error. Clients should drop the connection if they receive bitfields that are not of the correct size, or if the bitfield has any of the spare bits set.\r\nrequest: <len=0013><id=6><index><begin><length>\r\n\r\nThe request message is fixed length, and is used to request a block. The payload contains the following information:\r\n\r\n    * index: integer specifying the zero-based piece index\r\n    * begin: integer specifying the zero-based byte offset within the piece\r\n    * length: integer specifying the requested length. \r\n\r\nThis section is under dispute! Please use the discussion page to resolve this!\r\n\r\nView #1 According to the official specification, "All current implementations use 2^15 (32KB), and close connections which request an amount greater than 2^17 (128KB)." As early as version 3 or 2004, this behavior was changed to use 2^14 (16KB) blocks. As of version 4.0 or mid-2005, the mainline disconnected on requests larger than 2^14 (16KB); and some clients have followed suit. Note that block requests are smaller than pieces (>=2^18 bytes), so multiple requests will be needed to download a whole piece.\r\n\r\nStrictly, the specification allows 2^15 (32KB) requests. The reality is near all clients will now use 2^14 (16KB) requests. Due to clients that enforce that size, it is recommended that implementations make requests of that size. Due to smaller requests resulting in higher overhead due to tracking a greater number of requests, implementers are advised against going below 2^14 (16KB).\r\n\r\nThe choice of request block size limit enforcement is not nearly so clear cut. With mainline version 4 enforcing 16KB requests, most clients will use that size. At the same time 2^14 (16KB) is the semi-official (only semi because the official protocol document has not been updated) limit now, so enforcing that isn''t wrong. At the same time, allowing larger requests enlarges the set of possible peers, and except on very low bandwidth connections (<256kbps) multiple blocks will be downloaded in one choke-timeperiod, thus merely enforcing the old limit causes minimal performance degradation. Due to this factor, it is recommended that only the older 2^17 (128KB) maximum size limit be enforced.\r\n\r\nView #2 This section has contained falsehoods for a large portion of the time this page has existed. This is the third time I (uau) am correcting this same section for incorrect information being added, so I won''t rewrite it completely since it''ll probably be broken again... Current version has at least the following errors: Mainline started using 2^14 (16384) byte requests when it was still the only client in existence; only the "official specification" still talked about the obsolete 32768 byte value which was in reality neither the default size nor maximum allowed. In version 4 the request behavior did not change, but the maximum allowed size did change to equal the default size. In latest mainline versions the max has changed to 32768 (note that this is the first appearance of 32768 for either default or max size since the first ancient versions). "Most older clients use 32KB requests" is false. Discussion of larger requests fails to take latency effects into account.\r\npiece: <len=0009+X><id=7><index><begin><block>\r\n\r\nThe piece message is variable length, where X is the length of the block. The payload contains the following information:\r\n\r\n    * index: integer specifying the zero-based piece index\r\n    * begin: integer specifying the zero-based byte offset within the piece\r\n    * block: block of data, which is a subset of the piece specified by index. \r\n\r\ncancel: <len=0013><id<=8><index><begin><length>\r\n\r\nThe cancel message is fixed length, and is used to cancel block requests. The payload is identical to that of the "request" message. It is typically used during "End Game" (see the Algorithms section below).\r\nport: <len=0003><id=9><listen-port>\r\n\r\nThe port message is sent by newer versions of the Mainline that implements a DHT tracker. The listen port is the port this peer''s DHT node is listening on. This peer should be inserted in the local routing table (if DHT tracker is supported).\r\nAlgorithms\r\nQueuing\r\n\r\nThis section is under dispute! Please use the discussion page to resolve this!\r\n\r\nView #1In general peers are advised to keep a few unfullfilled requests on each connection. This is done because otherwise a full round trip is required from the download of one block to begining the download of a new block (round trip between PIECE message and next REQUEST message). On links with high BDP (bandwidth-delay-product, high latency or high bandwidth), this can result in a substantial performance loss.\r\n\r\nImplementer''s note: This the ''most crucial performance item. A static queue of 10 requests is reasonable for 16KB blocks on a 5mbps link with 50ms latency. Links with greater bandwidth are becoming very common so UI designers are urged to make this readily available for changing. Notably cable modems were known for traffic policing and increasing this might of aleviated some of the problems caused by this.\r\n\r\nView #2 NOTE: much of the information in this "Queuing" section is false or misleading. I''ll just note that the "defaults to 5 outstanding requests" hasn''t been true for a long time, "32 KB blocks" is misleading since you normally don''t use 32 KB blocks, and tuning queue length by changing it and trying to measure the effects is a bad idea.\r\nSuper Seeding\r\n\r\n(This was not part of the original specification)\r\n\r\nThe super-seed feature in S-5.5 and on is a new seeding algorithm designed to help a torrent initiator with limited bandwidth "pump up" a large torrent, reducing the amount of data it needs to upload in order to spawn new seeds in the torrent.\r\n\r\nWhen a seeding client enters "super-seed mode", it will not act as a standard seed, but masquerades as a normal client with no data. As clients connect, it will then inform them that it received a piece -- a piece that was never sent, or if all pieces were already sent, is very rare. This will induce the client to attempt to download only that piece.\r\n\r\nWhen the client has finished downloading the piece, the seed will not inform it of any other pieces until it has seen the piece it had sent previously present on at least one other client. Until then, the client will not have access to any of the other pieces of the seed, and therefore will not waste the seed''s bandwidth.\r\n\r\nThis method has resulted in much higher seeding efficiencies, by both inducing peers into taking only the rarest data, reducing the amount of redundant data sent, and limiting the amount of data sent to peers which do not contribute to the swarm. Prior to this, a seed might have to upload 150% to 200% of the total size of a torrent before other clients became seeds. However, a large torrent seeded with a single client running in super-seed mode was able to do so after only uploading 105% of the data. This is 150-200% more efficient than when using a standard seed.\r\n\r\nSuper-seed mode is ''NOT recommended for general use. While it does assist in the wider distribution of rare data, because it limits the selection of pieces a client can downlad, it also limits the ability of those clients to download data for pieces they have already partially retrieved. Therefore, super-seed mode is only recommended for initial seeding servers.\r\n\r\nWhy not rename it to e.g. "Initial Seeding Mode" or "Releaser Mode" then?\r\n\r\nPiece downloading strategy\r\n\r\nClients may choose to download pieces in random order.\r\n\r\nA better strategy is to download pieces in rarest first order. The client can determine this by keeping the initial bitfield from each peer, and updating it with every ''have message. Then, the client can download the pieces that appear least frequently in these peer bitfields. Note that any Rarest First strategy should include randomization among at least several of the least common pieces, as having many clients all attempting to jump on the same "least common" piece would be counter productive.\r\nEnd Game\r\n\r\nWhen a download is almost complete, there''s a tendency for the last few blocks to trickle in slowly. To speed this up, the client sends requests for all of its missing blocks to all of its peers. To keep this from becoming horribly inefficient, the client also sends a cancel to everyone else every time a block arrives.\r\n\r\nThere is no documented thresholds, recommended percentages, or block counts that could be used as a guide or Recommended Best Practice here.\r\n\r\nWhen to enter end game mode is an area of discussion. Some clients enter end game when all pieces have been requested. Others wait until the number of blocks left is lower than the number of blocks in transit, and no more than 20. There seems to be agreement that it''s a good idea to keep the number of pending blocks low (1 or 2 blocks) to minimize the overhead, and if you randomize the blocks requested, there''s a lower chance of downloading duplicates. More on the protocol overhead can be found here: http://hal.inria.fr/inria-00000156/en\r\nChoking and Optimistic Unchoking\r\n\r\nChoking is done for several reasons. TCP congestion control behaves very poorly when sending over many connections at once. Also, choking lets each peer use a tit-for-tat-ish algorithm to ensure that they get a consistent download rate.\r\n\r\nThe choking algorithm described below is the currently deployed one. It is very important that all new algorithms work well both in a network consisting entirely of themselves and in a network consisting mostly of this one.\r\n\r\nThere are several criteria a good choking algorithm should meet. It should cap the number of simultaneous uploads for good TCP performance. It should avoid choking and unchoking quickly, known as ''fibrillation''. It should reciprocate to peers who let it download. Finally, it should try out unused connections once in a while to find out if they might be better than the currently used ones, known as optimistic unchoking.\r\n\r\nThe currently deployed choking algorithm avoids fibrillation by only changing choked peers once every ten seconds.\r\n\r\nReciprocation and number of uploads capping is managed by unchoking the four peers which have the best upload rate and are interested. This maximizes the client''s download rate. These four peers are referred to as downloaders, because they are interested in downloading from the client.\r\n\r\nPeers which have a better upload rate (as compared to the downloaders) but aren''t interested get unchoked. If they become interested, the downloader with the worst upload rate gets choked. If a client has a complete file, it uses its upload rate rather than its download rate to decide which peers to unchoke.\r\n\r\nFor optimistic unchoking, at any one time there is a single peer which is unchoked regardless of its upload rate (if interested, it counts as one of the four allowed downloaders). Which peer is optimistically unchoked rotates every 30 seconds. Newly connected peers are three times as likely to start as the current optimistic unchoke as anywhere else in the rotation. This gives them a decent chance of getting a complete piece to upload.\r\nAnti-snubbing\r\n\r\nOccasionally a BitTorrent peer will be choked by all peers which it was formerly downloading from. In such cases it will usually continue to get poor download rates until the optimistic unchoke finds better peers. To mitigate this problem, when over a minute goes by without getting any piece data while downloading from a peer, BitTorrent assumes it is "snubbed" by that peer and doesn''t upload to it except as an optimistic unchoke. This frequently results in more than one concurrent optimistic unchoke, (an exception to the exactly one optimistic unchoke rule mentioned above), which causes download rates to recover much more quickly when they falter.\r\nOfficial Extensions To The Protocol\r\n\r\nCurrently there are a few official extensions to the protocol.\r\nFast Peers Extensions\r\n\r\n    * Reserved Bit: The third least significant bit in the 8th reserved byte i.e. reserved[ 7 ] |= 0x04 \r\n\r\nThese extensions serve multiple purposes. They allow a peer to more quickly bootstrap into a swarm by giving a peer a specific set of pieces which they will be allowed download regardless of choked status. They reduce message overhead by adding HaveAll and HaveNone messages and allow explicit rejection of piece requests whereas previously only implicit rejection was possible meaning that a peer might be left waiting for a piece that would never be delivered.\r\n\r\nThe specificication is documented at the BitTorrent site here: http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0006.html\r\n\r\n\r\nDistributed Hash Table\r\n\r\n    * Reserved Bit: The last bit in the 8th reserved byte i.e. reserved[ 7 ] |= 0x01 \r\n\r\nThis extension is to allow for the tracking of peers downloading torrents without the use of a standard tracker. A peer implementing this protocol becomes a "tracker" and stores lists of other nodes/peers which can be used to locate new peers.\r\n\r\nThe specification is documented at the BitTorrent site here: http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0005.html\r\nConnection Encryption\r\n\r\nThis extension allows the creation of encrypted connections between peers. This can be used to bypass ISPs throttling BitTorrent traffic.\r\n\r\nThe specification is documented at http://www.azureuswiki.com/index.php/Message_Stream_Encryption\r\n\r\nThe documentation is fairly complete, but ideally it would be clarified on several points including guidance on when encrypted connections should be attempted, fallback procedures to regular connections etc.\r\nUnofficial Extensions To The Protocol\r\nAzureus Messaging Protocol\r\n\r\n    * Reserved Bit: 1 \r\n\r\nA protocol in its own right - if two clients indicate they support the protocol, then they should switch over to using it. It allows normal BitTorrent as well extension messages to be sent over it, and is documented here. Currently implemented by Azureus and Transmission.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to use both this protocol and the LibTorrent extension protocol at the same time - if both clients indicate they support both, then they should follow the semantics defined by the Extension Negotiation Protocol.\r\nWebSeeding\r\n\r\nThe possibility to seed a torrent via a web server is generally called WebSeeding. It allows the HTTP server to work as a peer in the BitTorrent network.\r\n\r\nThere are at least two specification for how to combine a torrent download with a HTTP download. The first standard, implemented by BitTornado is quite easy to implement in the client, but is intrusive on the HTTP in that it requires a script handling requests on the server side. i.e. A plain HTTP server that just serves plain files isn''t enough. The benfits is that the script can be more abuse resistant. This specification is found here: http://bittornado.com/docs/webseed-spec.txt\r\n\r\nThe second specification requires slightly more from the client, but downloads from plain HTTP servers. It is specified here: http://www.getright.com/seedtorrent.html. It has been implemented by GetRight, libtorrent and Mainline.\r\nExtension protocol\r\n\r\n    * Reserved Bit: 44, the fourth most significant bit in the 6th reserved byte i.e. reserved[ 5 ] |= 0x10 \r\n\r\nThis is a protocol for exchanging extension information and was derived from an early version of azureus'' extension protocol. It adds one message for exchanging arbitrary handshake information including defined extension messages, mapping extensions to specific message IDs. It is documented here: http://www.libtorrent.org/extension_protocol.html and is implemented by libtorrent, uTorrent and Mainline.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to use both this protocol and the Azureus Messaging Protocol at the same time - if both clients indicate they support both, then they should follow the semantics defined by the Extension Negotiation Protocol.\r\nExtension Negotiation Protocol\r\n\r\n    * Reserved bits: 47 and 48 \r\n\r\nThese bits are used to allow two clients that support both the Azureus Messaging Protocol and LibTorrent''s extension protocol to decide which of the two extensions should be used for communication, and is defined here.\r\nBitTorrent Location-aware Protocol 1.0\r\n\r\n    * Reserved Bit: 21 \r\n\r\nA Protocol, considering peers location (in geographical terms) for better performance. Specification can be found here.\r\nSimpleBT Extension Protocol\r\n\r\n    * Reserved Bits: fist reserved byte = 0x01, following bytes may need to be set to zero \r\n\r\nAn extension using message id 9 to add peer exchange and connection statistics exchange. The specification can be found here. The extension was in use in SimpleBT 0.32 to 0.36.1. Later versions of SimpleBT were called BitComet and used the similar but incompatible BitComet Extension Protocol.\r\nBitComet Extension Protocol\r\n\r\n    * Reserved Bits: first two reserved bytes = "ex" \r\n\r\nThere appears to be no official documentation.\r\n\r\nIn this protocol a peer announces the supported extensions by sending a message <len=0001+X><id=0xA0><extension 1>...<extension X> where <extension n> is (usually) the message id of the supported extension. When an extension consists of multiple messages, all ids need to be mentioned.\r\n\r\nExtensions currently in use (TODO: reverse engineer semantics):\r\n\r\n    * 0xA0 (EXT_SUPPORT) see above, needs to be included in its parameter list\r\n    * 0xA1 (EXT_PEERREQ) ask for peer exchange, used in conjunction with EXT_PEERS\r\n    * 0xA2 (EXT_PEERS) in reply to EXT_PEERREQ and for updates afterwards\r\n    * 0xA3 (EXT_AUTH_SEED) appeared in BitComet 0.53, used in conjunction with EXT_AUTH_CRYPTOED\r\n    * 0xA4 (EXT_AUTH_CRYPTOED)\r\n    * 0xA5 (EXT_CONNGRANT) appeared in BitComet 0.48, used in conjunction with EXT_CONNACCEPT\r\n    * 0xA6 (EXT_CONNACCEPT)\r\n    * 0x06 (?) announced by BitSpirit instead of EXT_CONNACCEPT\r\n    * 0xA7 (EXT_CHAT_MESSAGE) appeared in BitComet 0.53, vanished in 0.71\r\n    * 0xA9 (EXT_HASH_REQ) appeared in BitComet 0.54, vanished in 0.71, used in conjunction with EXT_HASH\r\n    * 0xAA (EXT_HASH)\r\n    * 0xAB (EXT_REPORT_RATE_old) appeared in BitComet 0.54, was replaced by EXT_REPORT_RATE_new in 0.57\r\n    * 0xAC (EXT_REPORT_INFO) appeared in BitComet 0.54, vanished in 0.71, reappeared in 0.82\r\n    * 0xAD (EXT_REPORT_RATE_new) appeared in BitComet 0.57, vanished in 0.75, reappeared in 0.82\r\n    * 0xAE (EXT_BC_PASSPORT) appeared in BitComet 0.75\r\n    * 0xAF (EXT_DHE_PREFERRED) appeared in BitComet 0.75\r\n    * 0xB0 (?) appeared in BitComet 0.86\r\n    * 0xC0 (?) does not correspond to a message id, appeared in BitComet 0.49 \r\n\r\nA minimum implementation needs only accept EXT_SUPPORT, but EXT_PEERREQ and EXT_PEERS are supported by all known implementations.\r\nReserved Bytes\r\n\r\nThe reserved bits are numbered 1-64 in the following table for ease of identification. Bit 1 corresponds to the most significant bit of the first reserved byte. Bit 8 corresponds to the least significant bit of the first reserved byte (i.e. byte[ 0 ] |= 0x01). Bit 64 is the least significant bit of the last reserved byte i.e. byte[ 7 ] |= 0x01\r\n\r\nAn orange bit is a known unofficial extension, a red bit is an unknown unofficial extension.\r\nReserved Bits Bit 	Use 	Azureus 	BitComet 	MainLine 	MonoTorrent 	?Torrent 	libtorrent 	KTorrent 	BitLord 	XBT 	Transmission\r\n1 	Azureus Extended Messaging 	Yes 	 ? 	 ? 	 ? 	 ?

Although the facilities at the range are managed by the 99th Air Base Wing at Nellis Air Force Base, the Groom facility appears to be run as an adjunct of the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) at Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert, around 160 miles (260 km) from Groom, and as such the base is known as Air Force Flight Test Center (Detachment 3).\r\n\r\nOther names used for the facility include Dreamland, Paradise Ranch, Home Base, Watertown Strip, Groom Lake and most recently Homey Airport. The area is part of the Nellis Military Operations Area, and the restricted airspace around the field is referred to as (R-4808N), known by the military pilots in the area as The Box.\r\n\r\nThe intense secrecy surrounding the base, the very existence of which the U.S. government barely acknowledges, has led it to become the frequent subject of conspiracy theories and a central component to unidentified flying object (UFO) folklore.\r\n\r\n    * 1 Geography\r\n    * 2 Operations at Groom Lake\r\n          o 2.1 U-2 program\r\n          o 2.2 Blackbird programs\r\n          o 2.3 Have Blue/F-117 program\r\n    * 3 Runways\r\n    * 4 U.S. government''s positions on Area 51\r\n          o 4.1 Environmental lawsuit\r\n          o 4.2 1974 Skylab photography\r\n    * 5 UFO and other conspiracy theories concerning Area 51\r\n    * 6 Portrayal in popular culture\r\n    * 7 See also\r\n    * 8 References\r\n          o 8.1 General references\r\n          o 8.2 Specific references\r\n    * 9 External links\r\n\r\nGeography\r\nMap showing Area 51, NAFR, and the NTS\r\n\r\nArea 51 shares a border with the Yucca Flat region of the Nevada Test Site (NTS), the location of 739 of the 928 nuclear tests conducted by the United States Department of Energy at NTS. The Yucca Mountain nuclear storage facility is approximately 40 miles (64 km) southwest of Groom Lake.\r\n\r\nThe same "Area xx" naming scheme is used for other parts of the Nevada Test Site.\r\n\r\nThe area is connected to the internal NTS road network, with paved roads leading south to Mercury and west to Yucca Flat. Leading northeast from the lake, the wide and well-maintained Groom Lake Road runs through a pass in the Jumbled Hills. The road formerly led to mines in the Groom basin, but has been improved since their closure. Its winding course runs past a security checkpoint, but the restricted area around the base extends further east. After leaving the restricted area, Groom Lake Road descends eastward to the floor of the Tikaboo Valley, passing the dirt-road entrances to several small ranches, before converging with State Route 375, the "Extraterrestrial Highway", south of Rachel.\r\n\r\nOperations at Groom Lake\r\n\r\nGroom Lake is not a conventional airbase, as frontline units are not normally deployed there. It instead appears to be used during the development, testing, and training phases for new aircraft. Once these aircraft have been approved by the United States Air Force or other agencies such as the CIA, operation of that aircraft is generally conducted from a normal air force base. Groom is reported, however, to be the permanent home for a small number of Soviet-designed aircraft which are analyzed and used for training purposes.\r\n\r\nSoviet spy satellites obtained photographs of the Groom Lake area during the height of the Cold War, and later civilian satellites produced detailed images of the base and its surroundings. These images support only modest conclusions about the base; they depict a nondescript base, long airstrip, hangars and the lake, but nothing that supports some of the claims about underground facilities.\r\nSatellite view of Area 51 from 1968.\r\n\r\nThough no ICAO identifier for the base appears on any official document, in December 2007, airline pilots noticed that the base had appeared in their aircraft navigation systems'' latest Jeppesen database revision as "KXTA".\r\n\r\nU-2 program\r\n\r\n    Main article: Lockheed U-2\r\n\r\nGroom Lake was used for bombing and artillery practice during World War II, but was then abandoned until April 1955, when it was selected by Lockheed''s Skunk Works team as the ideal location to test the forthcoming U-2 spy plane. The lakebed made an ideal strip from which they could operate the troublesome test aircraft, and the Emigrant Valley''s mountain ranges and the NTS perimeter protected the test site from prying eyes and outside interference.\r\n\r\nLockheed constructed a makeshift base at the location, then known as Site II or "The Ranch", consisting of little more than a few shelters, workshops and trailer homes in which to house its small team. In only three months a 5000-foot runway was constructed and was servicable by July 1955. The Ranch received its first U-2 delivery on July 24, 1955 from Burbank on a C-124 Globemaster II cargo plane, accompanied by Lockheed technicians on a Douglas DC-3[14]. The first U-2 lifted off from at Groom on August 4, 1955. A U-2 fleet under the control of the CIA began overflights of Soviet territory by mid-1956.\r\n\r\nDuring this period, the NTS continued to perform a series of atmospheric nuclear explosions. U-2 operations throughout 1957 were frequently disrupted by the Plumbbob series of atomic tests, which detonated over two-dozen devices at the NTS. The Plumbbob-Hood explosion on July 5 scattered fallout across Groom and forced a temporary evacuation.\r\n\r\nBlackbird programs\r\n\r\n    Main article: SR-71 Blackbird\r\n\r\nOXCART aircraft on the ramp at Groom Lake/Area 51 in 1964. There are ten aircraft in the photo; the first eight are OXCART machines, and the last two are Air Force YF-12As.\r\n\r\nEven before U-2 development was complete, Lockheed began work on its successor, the CIA''s OXCART project, a Mach-3 high altitude reconnaissance aircraft, a later variant of which became the famed USAF SR-71 Blackbird. The Blackbird''s flight characteristics and maintenance requirements forced a massive expansion of facilities and runways at Groom Lake. By the time the first A-12 Blackbird prototype flew at Groom in 1962, the main runway had been lengthened to 8,500 ft (2,600 m), and the base boasted a complement of over 1,000 personnel. It had fueling tanks, a control tower, and a baseball diamond. Security was greatly enhanced, the small civilian mine in the Groom basin was closed, and the area surrounding the valley was made an exclusive military preserve. Groom saw the first flight of most major Blackbird variants: A-12, the abortive YF-12 interceptor variant, and the D-21 Blackbird-based drone project. The A-12 would remain at Groom Lake until 1968. (The SR-71 first flew at Palmdale, California.)\r\n\r\nHave Blue/F-117 program\r\n\r\n    Main article: Lockheed Have Blue\r\n\r\nThe Lockheed Have Blue prototype stealth fighter (a smaller cousin of the F-117 Nighthawk) first flew at Groom in December 1977. Testing of a series of ultra-secret prototypes continued there until mid-1981, when testing transitioned to the initial production of F-117 stealth fighters. In addition to flight-testing, Groom performed radar profiling, F-117 weapons testing, and was the location for training of the first group of frontline USAF F-117 pilots. Subsequently, the still highly classified active-service F-117 operations moved to the nearby Tonopah Test Range, and finally to Holloman Air Force Base.\r\nArea 51 border and warning sign stating that "photography is prohibited" and that "use of deadly force is authorized" under the terms of the 1950 McCarran Internal Security Act. A government vehicle is parked on the hilltop; from there, security agents observe the approach to Groom Lake.\r\n\r\nCommuter service is provided along Groom Lake Road by a bus, catering to a small number of employees living in several small communities beyond the NTS boundary (although it is not clear whether these workers are employed at Groom or at other facilities in the NTS). The bus travels Groom Lake Road and stops at Crystal Springs, Ash Springs, and Alamo, and parks at the Alamo courthouse overnight.\r\n\r\nRunways\r\n\r\nThe airbase, given the ICAO airport identifier code of KXTA and listed as "Homey Airport"] in aviation GPS databases, has seven runways including one that now appears to be closed. The closed runway, 14R/32L, is also by far the longest with a total length of approximately 7,100 meters (23,300 ft), not including stopway. The other runways are two asphalt runways, the 14L/32R with a length of 3,650 meters (12,000 ft) and 12/30 with a length of 1,650 meters (5,400 ft), and four runways located on the salt lake. These four runways are 09L/27R and 09R/27L, which are both approximately 3,500 meters (11,450 ft), and 03L/21R and 03R/21L, which are both approximately 3,050 meters (10,000 ft). The base has a helipad. The probably-inadvertent release of the airport data led to advice by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) that student pilots should be explicitly warned about KXTA, not to consider it as a waypoint or destination for any flight even though it now appears in public navigation databases.\r\n\r\nU.S. government''s positions on Area 51\r\nA letter from the USAF replying to a query about Area 51\r\n\r\nOn July 14, 2003 the Federal Government admitted the facility''s existence, tacitly conceding that the Air Force has an "operating location" near the lake, but does not provide any further information.\r\n\r\nUnlike much of the Nellis range, the area surrounding the lake is permanently off-limits both to civilian and normal military air traffic. Radar stations protect the area, and unauthorized personnel are quickly expelled. Even military pilots training in the NAFR risk disciplinary action if they accidentally stray into the exclusionary "box" surrounding Groom''s airspace.\r\nA montage of available USGS satellite photography showing southern Nevada. The NTS and the surrounding lands are visible; the NAFR and neighboring land has been removed\r\n\r\nPerimeter security is provided by uniformed private security guards working for EG&G''s security subcontractor Wackenhut, who patrol in desert camouflage Jeep Cherokees and Humvees, and more recently, champagne-colored Ford F-150 pickups and gray Chevy 2500 4X4 pickups. Although the guards are armed with M16s, no violent encounters with Area 51 observers have been reported; instead, the guards generally follow visitors near the perimeter and radio for the Lincoln County Sheriff. Deadly force is authorized if violators who attempt to breach the secured area fail to heed warnings to halt. Fines of around $600 seem to be the normal course of action, although some visitors and journalists report receiving follow-up visits from FBI agents. Some observers have been detained on public land for pointing camera equipment at the base. Surveillance is supplemented using buried motion sensors and by HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopters.\r\n\r\nThe base does not appear on public U.S. government maps the USGS topographic map for the area only shows the long-disused Groom Mine. A civil aviation chart published by the Nevada Department of Transportation shows a large restricted area, but defines it as part of the Nellis restricted airspace. The official aeronautical navigation charts for the area show Groom Lake but omit the airport facilities. Similarly the National Atlas page showing federal lands in Nevada does not distinguish between the Groom block and other parts of the Nellis range. Although officially declassified, the original film taken by U.S. Corona spy satellite in the 1960s has been altered prior to declassification; in answer to freedom of information queries, the government responds that these exposures (which map to Groom and the entire NAFR) appear to have been destroyed. Terra satellite images (which were publicly available) were removed from web servers (including Microsoft''s "Terraserver") in 2004, and from the monochrome 1 m resolution USGS data dump made publicly available. NASA Landsat 7 images are still available (these are used in the NASA World Wind). Higher resolution (and more recent) images from other satellite imagery providers (including Russian providers and the IKONOS) are commercially available. These show, in considerable detail, the runway marking, base facilities, aircraft, and vehicles.\r\n\r\nNevada''s state government, recognizing the folklore surrounding the base might afford the otherwise neglected area some tourism potential, officially renamed the section of State Route 375 near Area 51 "The Extraterrestrial Highway", and posted fancifully illustrated signs along its length.\r\n\r\nAlthough federal property within the base is exempt from state and local taxes, facilities owned by private contractors are not. Area 51 researcher Glenn Campbell claimed in 1994 that the base only declares a taxable value of $2 million to the Lincoln County tax assessor, who is unable to enter the area to perform an assessment.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental lawsuit\r\n\r\nIn 1994, five unnamed civilian contractors and the widows of contractors Walter Kasza and Robert Frost sued the USAF and the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Their suit, in which they were represented by George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, alleged they had been present when large quantities of unknown chemicals had been burned in open pits and trenches at Groom. Biopsies taken from the complainants were analyzed by Rutgers University biochemists, who found high levels of dioxin, dibenzofuran, and trichloroethylene in their body fat. The complainants alleged they had sustained skin, liver, and respiratory injuries due to their work at Groom, and that this had contributed to the deaths of Frost and Kasza. The suit sought compensation for the injuries they had sustained, claiming the USAF had illegally handled toxic materials, and that the EPA had failed in its duty to enforce the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (which governs handling of dangerous materials). They also sought detailed information about the chemicals to which they were allegedly exposed, hoping this would facilitate the medical treatment of survivors. Congressman Lee H. Hamilton, former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told 60 Minutes reporter Leslie Stahl, "The Air Force is classifying all information about Area 51 in order to protect themselves from a lawsuit."\r\n\r\nCiting the State Secrets Privilege, the government petitioned trial judge U.S. District Judge Philip Pro (of the United States District Court for the District of Nevada in Las Vegas) to disallow disclosure of classified documents or examination of secret witnesses, alleging this would expose classified information and threaten national security. When Judge Pro rejected the government''s argument, President Bill Clinton issued a Presidential Determination, exempting what it called, "The Air Force''s Operating Location Near Groom Lake, Nevada" from environmental disclosure laws. Consequently, Pro dismissed the suit due to lack of evidence. Turley appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, on the grounds that the government was abusing its power to classify material. Secretary of the Air Force Sheila E. Widnall filed a brief that stated that disclosures of the materials present in the air and water near Groom "can reveal military operational capabilities or the nature and scope of classified operations." The Ninth Circuit rejected Turley''s appeal, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear it, putting an end to the complainants'' case.\r\n\r\nThe President continues to annually issue a determination continuing the Groom exception. This, and similarly tacit wording used in other government communications, is the only formal recognition the U.S. Government has ever given that Groom Lake is more than simply another part of the Nellis complex.\r\n\r\nAn unclassified memo on the safe handling of F117 material was posted on an Air Force website in 2005. This discussed the same materials for which the complainants had requested information (information the government had claimed was classified). The memo was removed shortly after journalists became aware of it.\r\n\r\n1974 Skylab photography\r\n\r\nIn January 2006, space historian Dwayne A. Day published an article in online aerospace magazine The Space Review titled "Astronauts and Area 51: the Skylab Incident." The article was based around a recently declassified memo written in 1974 to CIA director William Colby by an unknown CIA official. The memo reported that astronauts on board Skylab 4 had, as part of a larger program, inadvertently photographed a location of which the memo said "There were specific instructions not to do this. was the only location which had such an instruction." Although the name of the location was obscured, the context led Day to believe that the subject was Groom Lake.\r\n\r\nThe memo details debate between federal agencies regarding whether the images should be classified, with Department of Defense agencies arguing that it should, and NASA and the State Department arguing against classification. The memo itself questions the legality of unclassified images to be retroactively classified.\r\n\r\nRemarks on the memo, handwritten apparently by DCI (Director of Central Intelligence) Colby himself, read:\r\n\r\n    He did raise it - said State Dept. people felt strongly. But he inclined leave decision to me (DCI) - I confessed some question over need to protect since:\r\n\r\n       1. USSR has it from own sats\r\n       2. What really does it reveal?\r\n       3. If exposed, don''t we just say classified USAF work is done there?\r\n\r\nThe declassified documents do not disclose the outcome of discussions regarding the Skylab imagery, but were not placed in the federal government''s archive of satellite imagery along with the remaining Skylab 4 photographs.\r\n\r\nUFO and other conspiracy theories concerning Area 51\r\n\r\nIts secretive nature and undoubted connection to classified aircraft research, together with reports of unusual phenomena, have led Area 51 to become a focus of modern UFO and conspiracy theories. Some of the activities mentioned in such theories at Area 51 include:\r\n\r\n    * The storage, examination, and reverse engineering of crashed alien spacecraft (including material supposedly recovered at Roswell), the study of their occupants (living and dead), and the manufacture of aircraft based on alien technology.\r\n    * Meetings or joint undertakings with extraterrestrials.\r\n    * The development of exotic energy weapons (for SDI applications or otherwise) or means of weather control.\r\n    * The development of time travel and teleportation technology.\r\n    * The development of unusual and exotic propulsion systems related to the Aurora Program.\r\n    * Activities related to a supposed shadowy one world government and or the Majestic Twelve organization.\r\n\r\nMany of the hypotheses concern underground facilities at Groom or at nearby Papoose Lake, and include claims of a transcontinental underground railroad system, a disappearing airstrip (nicknamed the "Cheshire Airstrip", after Lewis Carroll''s Cheshire cat) which briefly appears when water is sprayed onto its camouflaged asphalt, and engineering based on alien technology. Publicly-available satellite imagery, however, reveals clearly visible landing strips.\r\n\r\nIn 1989, Bob Lazar came forward, claiming that he had worked at Area 51''s S-4, a facility at Papoose Lake, approximately 10 miles south of Groom Lake. He was contracted to aid in the reverse engineering of one of several flying saucers that the U.S. government had in its possession which he nicknamed "the sport model".\r\n\r\nThe 1996 documentary Dreamland directed by Bruce Burgess included an interview with a 71 year old mechanical engineer who claimed to be a former employee at Area 51 during the 1950s, working on a "flying disc simulator" built to train US Pilots, based on a disc originating from a crashed extraterrestrial craft. During his career at Area 51 he claimed to have worked with an extraterrestrial being whose name was "J-Rod", described as a telepathic translator.\r\n\r\nDan Burisch (pseudonym of Dan Crain) claimed in 2004 to have worked on cloning alien viruses at Area 51, alongside the alien named "J-Rod". Burisch''s scholarly credentials are the subject of much debate, as he was apparently working as a Las Vegas parole officer in 1989 while also earning a PhD at SUNY.\r\n\r\nPortrayal in popular culture\r\n\r\nPopular culture usually portrays Area 51 as a haven for aliens. The numerous conspiracy theories surrounding Area 51 have granted it a fairly high profile in popular culture, specifically in the area of science fiction. Dozens of movies and television shows deal with fictionalized events or happenings at the site. The most widely seen example is the 1996 action film Independence Day, in which the complex is shown to have been studying the crashed scout ship from the Roswell UFO incident of 1947. The heroes of the film later make their final attack from the airstrips at the base, and in a nod to established fact, Randy Quaid''s character Russell Casse at one point refers to the base not being shown on a state map of Nevada.\r\n\r\nThe 1998-2001 television series Seven Days took place largely inside the Area 51 complex itself, with the base depicted as being run by a covert National Security Agency operation which used time-travel made possible by alien technology recovered from the 1947 Roswell UFO incident.\r\n\r\nLara Croft infiltrates Area 51 in Tomb Raider 3. She must find a special stone called "Element 115." A non-stealthy playing style closes doors and makes the task more difficult.\r\n\r\nJoanna Dark infiltrates Area 51 in the multi-million selling first person shooter video game Perfect Dark. Her objectives are to meet up with a fellow secret agent, find the autopsy lab of the assumed to be dead alien named Elvis, and to get out successfully.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, "Hangar 51" is revealed to be the location of the government warehouse where the Ark of the Covenant was stored at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark, and where KGB agents go to recover the remains of the Roswell alien, eventually revealed to be an interdimensional being with a crystalline skeleton. Writer David Koepp acknowledged the number 51 as a reference to popular beliefs about the connection between Roswell and Area 51.\r\n\r\nIn the television series Stargate SG-1, Area 51 is used as a facility for storage and research of technology brought back to Earth from other planets.\r\n\r\nIn the Metal Gear series, Area 51 turns out to be one of the headquarters of the Illuminati group known as The Patriots, who manipulate the government, public, and economy from behind the scenes. The character Raiden is injured during an attempt to rescue Sunny.\r\n\r\nIn the comic Superman: Red Son, Abin Sur''s body is stored in Area 51 by order of J. Edgar Hoover. John F. Kennedy later gives Lex Luthor access to the base to develop weapons to defeat the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nSee also\r\n	North America portal\r\n\r\n    * Groom Range - mountain range north of the lakebed\r\n    * Woomera Prohibited Area - defense and aerospace testing area in Australia\r\n    * Kapustin Yar\r\n    * Area 51 (2005 video game)\r\n    * Dugway Proving Grounds - Restricted facility in the Utah desert.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nGeneral references\r\n\r\n    * Rich, Ben; Janos, Leo.

For other uses, see Skunkworks.\r\nEntrance plaza at the Skunk Works in Palmdale, California\r\nSkunk Works logo\r\n\r\nSkunk Works is an official alias for Lockheed Martin?s Advanced Development Programs (ADP), formerly called Lockheed Advanced Development Projects. Skunk Works is responsible for a number of famous aircraft designs, including the U-2, the SR-71, the F-117, and the F-22. Its largest current project is the F-35 Lightning II, which will be used in the air forces of several countries around the world. Production is expected to last for up to four decades.\r\n\r\n"Skunk works" or "skunkworks" is widely used in business, engineering, and technical fields to describe a group within an organization given a high degree of autonomy and unhampered by bureaucracy, tasked with working on advanced or secret projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n    * 1 History\r\n          o 1.1 Aircraft\r\n          o 1.2 Ships\r\n    * 2 Term origin\r\n    * 3 See also\r\n    * 4 References\r\n    * 5 External links\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n\r\nThe roots for the Skunk Works started in Burbank, California when Lockheed was tasked with building a high speed, highly maneuverable fighter to compete with the aircraft coming out of the Messerschmitt factory.[1] Lockheed Model 22 rolled out in December 1938 and had her maiden flight on January 27, 1939. This plane would later be known as the P-38 Lightning, and would be one of the most successful aircraft in the U.S. military for its time.\r\n\r\nLockheed considers June 1943 the birth month of the Skunk Works known today:\r\n\r\n    The Air Tactical Service Command (ATSC) of the Army Air Force met with Lockheed Aircraft Corporation to express its need for a jet fighter. A rapidly growing German jet threat gave Lockheed an opportunity to develop an airframe around the most powerful jet engine that the allied forces had access to, the British Goblin. Lockheed was chosen to develop the jet because of its past interest in jet development and its previous contracts with the Air Force. One month after the ATSC and Lockheed meeting, a young engineer by the name of Clarence L. ?Kelly? Johnson and other associate engineers hand delivered the initial XP-80 proposal to the ATSC. Two days later the go-ahead was given to Lockheed to start development and the Skunk Works was born, with Kelly Johnson at the helm. The formal contract for the XP-80 did not arrive at Lockheed until October 16, 1943; some four months after work had already begun. This would prove to be a common practice within the Skunk Works. Many times a customer would come to the Skunk Works with a request and on a handshake the project would begin, no contracts in place, no official submittal process. Kelly Johnson and his Skunk Works team designed and built the XP-80 in only 143 days, seven less than was specified as the maximum allowed under the contract.\r\n\r\nLater, near the end of World War II, Skunk Works was tasked with developing the United States? first operational jet fighter?the P-80 Shooting Star. A small team of engineers led by Kelly Johnson created the first prototype in only 143 days. (Kelly Johnson headed the Skunk Works until 1975. He was succeeded by Ben Rich.)\r\n\r\nIn 1955, the Skunk Works received a contract to build a spyplane known as the U-2 with the intention of overflying the Soviet Union and photographing sites of strategic interest. The U-2 was tested at Groom Lake in the Nevada desert. The first overflight took place on July 4th 1956. The U-2 ceased overflights when Francis Gary Powers was shot down during a mission on May 1, 1960, while over Russia.\r\n\r\nThe Skunk Works had predicted that the U-2 would have a limited operational life over the Soviet Union. The CIA agreed. The Skunk Works got a contract in late 1959 to build five A-12 aircraft at a cost of $96 million. Building a Mach 3.0+ aircraft out of titanium posed enormous difficulties and the first flight did not occur until 1962. Several years later, the U.S. Air Force became interested in the design, and it ordered the SR-71 Blackbird, an improved two-seater version of the A-12. This aircraft first flew in 1966 and remained in service until 1998.\r\n\r\nThe D-21 drone, similar in design to the Blackbird, was built to overfly the Lop Nur nuclear test facility in China. This drone sat on top of a specially modified A-12, known as M-21, of which there were two built. No D-21s were successfully recovered after being launched from M-21s, although a few were deployed and recovered from B-52s.\r\n\r\nIn 1976 The Skunk Works began production on a pair of stealth technology demonstrators for the U.S. Air Force named Have Blue in Building 82 at Burbank. These scaled down demonstrators, built in only 18 months, were a revolutionary step forward in aviation technology. After a series of successful test fights beginning in 1977, the Air force awarded Skunk Works the contract to build the F-117 stealth fighter on November 1, 1978.\r\n\r\nAfter the Cold War ended in 1989, Lockheed reorganized its operations and relocated the Skunk Works to Site 10 at U.S. Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale, California, where it remains in operation today.\r\n\r\nAircraft\r\nA modern Skunk Works project leverages an older: LASRE atop the SR-71 Blackbird.\r\n\r\n    * P-38 Lightning\r\n    * P-80 Shooting Star\r\n    * Lockheed XF-90\r\n    * F-104 Starfighter\r\n    * Lockheed U-2\r\n    * QT-2PC PRIZE CREW\r\n    * Lockheed YO-3\r\n    * Lockheed A-12\r\n    * SR-71 Blackbird\r\n    * Lockheed D-21/M-21\r\n    * XST (Have Blue)\r\n    * F-117 Nighthawk\r\n    * F-22 Raptor\r\n    * Lockheed Martin X-35\r\n    * Lockheed X-27\r\n    * Lockheed Martin Polecat\r\n    * Quiet Supersonic Transport\r\n    * Lockheed Martin Cormorant\r\n\r\nShips\r\n\r\n    * Sea Shadow\r\n\r\nTerm origin\r\nThe Skunk Works logo as seen on one of Lockheed Martin?s hangars.\r\n\r\nThe term "Skunk Works" came from the Al Capp comic strip Li?l Abner, which was popular in the 1940s. In the comic, the "Skonk Works" was a backwoods still operated by Big Barnsmell, known as the "inside man at the Skonk Works". In his secret facility, he made "kickapoo joy juice" by grinding dead skunks and worn shoes into a smoldering vat.\r\n\r\nThe original Lockheed facility, during the development of the P-80 Shooting Star, was located adjacent to a malodorous plastics factory. According to Ben Rich?s memoir, an engineer showed up to work one day wearing a Civil Defense gas mask as a gag. To comment on the smell and the secrecy the project entailed, another engineer, Irving Culver, referred to the facility as "Skonk Works". As the development was very secret the employees were told to be careful even with how they answered phone calls. One day, when the Department of the Navy was trying to reach the Lockheed management for the P-80 project, the call was accidentally transferred to Culver?s desk. Culver answered the phone in his trademark fashion of the time, by picking up the phone and stating "Skonk Works, inside man Culver". "What?" replied the voice at the other end. "Skonk Works", Culver repeated. The name stuck. Culver later said at an interview conducted in 1993 that "when Kelly Johnson heard about the incident, he promptly fired me. It didn?t really matter, since he was firing me about twice a day anyways."\r\n\r\nAt the request of the comic strip copyright holders, Lockheed changed the name of the advanced development company to "Skunk Works" in the 1960s. The name "Skunk Works" and the skunk design are now registered trademarks of the Lockheed Martin Corporation.\r\n\r\nThe term "Skunk Works" is a registered trademark of Lockheed Martin; the company also holds several registrations of it with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. They have filed several challenges against registrants of domain names containing variations on the term under anti-cybersquatting policies, and have lost a case under the .uk domain name dispute resolution service against a company selling cannabis seeds and paraphernalia, which used the word "skunkworks" in its domain name (referring to "Skunk", a variety of the cannabis plant). Lockheed Martin claimed the company registered the domain in order to disrupt its business and that consumer confusion might result. The respondent company argued that Lockheed "used its size, resources and financial position to employ ''bullyboy'' tactics against . . . a very small company."\r\n\r\n[edit] See also\r\n\r\n    * Boeing Phantom Works\r\n    * Area 51\r\n    * USAF Plant 42\r\n\r\n[edit] References\r\n\r\n   1. ^ a b Bennis, Warren and Patricia Ward Biederman.

Aerospace contractors at Air Force Plant 42 share a common runway complex and either lease building space from the Air Force, or own their own building outright (commonly referred to as GOCO, or Government Owned Contractor Operated). There are eight separate production sites specially suited for advanced technology and/or "black" program projects. Currently the most well known contractors at Plant 42 are Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman.\r\n\r\nLocated in the southern Antelope Valley, Plant 42 is strategically located near Los Angeles area defense and aerospace contractor companies, as well as Edwards Air Force Base''s high-speed test corridors used under the direction of the base''s Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC). It is 65 miles (105 km) from the LA Civic Center and 37 miles (60 km) from Edwards'' flightline.\r\n\r\n\r\n    * 1 Overview\r\n    * 2 History\r\n    * 3 Skunk Works\r\n    * 4 Civilian air transport operations\r\n    * 5 Current projects\r\n    * 6 Past projects\r\n    * 7 Public airparks\r\n    * 8 FAA operations\r\n    * 9 See also\r\n    * 10 References\r\n    * 11 External links\r\n\r\nOverview\r\n\r\nPlant 42 controls over 5,800 acres (23 km?) of Mojave Desert land north of Avenue P and south of Columbia Way (Avenue M). The western border is Sierra Highway, and the Plant extends east to around 40th Street East south of Avenue N to Avenue P and 50th Street East north of Avenue N to Columbia Way (Avenue M). It has two runways: 4/22, and 7/25. Runway 7/25 was built to withstand an 8.3 Richter Scale earthquake, and, because of its status as one of the world''s strongest runways, is a tremendous asset to the Antelope Valley and to California''s infrastructure and economy. Plant 42 currently has an employment level of around 6,400 and has a combined annual payroll of over $320 million (USD).[citation needed] It generally ranks third overall as the Antelope Valley''s largest employer, trailing only Edwards Air Force Base and Los Angeles County in the number of workers employed.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n\r\nThe property now called Plant 42 was first activated as an emergency air landing strip in 1940 prior to the entry of the United States in World War II. It also provided B-25 training to military aviators during the war. Declared surplus by the federal government in 1946, it became a commercial airport for Los Angeles County. The outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 caused the Air Force to reactivate the property for use in final assembly and flight testing of military jet aircraft.\r\n\r\nBoth the U. S. Air Force and its aircraft contractors needed a location away from major population centers - due to sonic booms, other noises and security concerns - but close enough to the major centers of aircraft design and production, while having excellent flying weather the year around. The land which became Plant 42 fit the bill perfectly from the perspectives of all the concerned interests in military aircraft and national defense. Consequently, the Air Force agreed to purchase the land from Los Angeles County in 1951. Lockheed put together a master plan for the property per its Air Force contract, and after the approval of this master plan in 1953, the County transferred ownership of the land to the Federal Government in 1954. Since then Lockheed, looked upon with favor by the Air Force at this time, established its permanent presence at Plant 42. Its first step in doing so was to sign a lease in 1956 for 237 acres (1 km?) for use in its Air Force support programs of manufacturing aircraft and flight testing.\r\n\r\nSkunk Works\r\n\r\nLockheed''s famed Skunk Works (black project workers), which developed such aircraft as the U-2, SR-71 Blackbird and F-117 Nighthawk, is at Site 10 of the complex (actually private property with secure access to Plant 42 airfield), near Sierra Highway, and relocated to Plant 42 from its original Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport (now Bob Hope Airport) site in Burbank after the end of the Cold War. Its present hangar was constructed in 1968 and the outer walls of the structure were put up in a matter of days. Its hangar originally was built for the Lockheed L-1011 Tristar passenger jet project.\r\n\r\nCivilian air transport operations\r\n\r\nIn 1989, Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA), a department of the City of Los Angeles, and the U.S. Air Force came to an agreement concerning use of the Plant 42 complex''s facilities and land for commercial use. The agreement allows a maximum of 400 flights per day. LAWA has used Plant 42''s facilities in past years when at one point in the early 1990s several airlines used the Palmdale Regional Airport terminal sited on Plant 42. This civilian terminal was unused from 1998 to 2004; on December 29, 2004 civilian use resumed when Scenic Airlines began scheduled service to North Las Vegas, Nevada, although that service officially terminated in January 2006. United Airlines began daily service to San Francisco International Airport in June 2007.\r\n\r\nCurrent projects\r\n\r\nCurrent projects include design, engineering, pre-production, production, modification, flight testing, servicing and repair mission related activities to the following:\r\n\r\n    * B-2 Spirit\r\n    * F-22 Raptor\r\n    * F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF)\r\n    * F-117A Nighthawk\r\n    * U-2\r\n    * B-52\r\n    * Global Hawk\r\n\r\nPast projects\r\n\r\nPast projects included:\r\n\r\n    * Each of the Space Shuttles\r\n    * Modernization of the Space Shuttle Columbia''s cockpit area\r\n    * Lockheed L-1011 Tristar passenger jet\r\n    * B-1 Lancer Bomber\r\n    * XB-70\r\n    * X-15\r\n    * SR-71 Blackbird\r\n\r\nand many, many others besides these few.\r\n\r\nPublic airparks\r\n\r\nBlackbird Airpark and the adjacent Palmdale Plant 42 Heritage Airpark have recently been opened on Plant 42 property along Avenue P (both are free to the public) with displays of the SR-71, U-2, Century Series fighters and other aircraft designed, engineereed, manufactured, and flight tested at its facilities. The Blackbird Airpark is an extension of the AFFTC Museum at Edwards AFB, while the Heritage Airpark is operated by the City of Palmdale. Both are manned by retirees who had previously worked in the aerospace industry, some actually having worked on the aircraft displayed at the two parks. All of the aircraft have been carefully restored for public display. Operating hours of the airparks are the same - Friday through Sunday (except in inclement weather) from 11:00 A.M. to 4:00 P.M. Pacific Time. On Federal Government holidays both airparks are closed. The two airparks are located at Avenue P and 25th Street East near Site 9.\r\n\r\nFAA operations\r\n\r\nThe FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) operates its Los Angeles Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) at its site on Plant 42 by Avenue P and 25th Street East. This center controls and tracks aircraft for the western United States, and covers non-local aircraft communication needs flying over California, Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. The center''s staff, which also is made up of personnel in other locations outside the Antelope Valley, was recognized for outstanding service in the FAA and aviation industry in 2004.\r\n\r\nSee also\r\n\r\n    * California World War II Army Airfields\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n    * Edwards Air Force Base\r\n    * GlobalSecurity.org/John Pike\r\n\r\n    * Plant 42 is at coordinates [show location on an interactive map] 34?37&#8242;45&#8243;N 118?05&#8242;13&#8243;W&#65279; / &#65279;34.629223, -118.087081&#65279; (Plant 42)Coordinates: [show location on an interactive map] 34?37&#8242;45&#8243;N 118?05&#8242;13&#8243;W&#65279; / &#65279;34.629223, -118.087081&#65279; (Plant 42)\r\n\r\nExternal links\r\n\r\n    * Plant 42: Link Between Groom Lake and California''s Antelope Valley\r\n    * Air Force Plant 42\r\n    * Palmdale, Summer 1999\r\n    * Blackbird Airpark\r\n    * Google Maps satellite photo of Plant 42\r\n', 1, 0, NULL, NULL);

Formally designated as the Manhattan Engineer District (MED), it refers specifically to the period of the project from 1939?1946 under the control of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, under the administration of General Leslie R. Groves. The scientific research was directed by American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer.\r\n\r\nThe project''s roots lay in scientists'' fears since the 1930s that Nazi Germany was also investigating nuclear weapons of its own. Born out of a small research program in 1939, the Manhattan Project eventually employed more than 130,000 people and cost nearly $2 billion USD ($24 billion in 2008 dollars based on CPI). It resulted in the creation of multiple production and research sites that operated in secret.\r\n\r\nThe three primary research and production sites of the project were the plutonium-production facility at what is now the Hanford Site, the uranium-enrichment facilities at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and the weapons research and design laboratory, now known as Los Alamos National Laboratory. Project research took place at over thirty sites across the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The MED maintained control over U.S. weapons production until the formation of the Atomic Energy Commission in January 1947.\r\n\r\n\r\n    * 1 Discovery of nuclear fission\r\n    * 2 Uranium Committee (1939-1941)\r\n    * 3 Acceleration of the Project\r\n    * 4 Project sites\r\n    * 5 Need for coordination\r\n    * 6 Manhattan Engineer District\r\n    * 7 Uranium bomb\r\n    * 8 Plutonium bomb\r\n    * 9 Similar efforts\r\n    * 10 See also\r\n    * 11 Notes\r\n    * 12 References\r\n    * 13 External links\r\n\r\nDiscovery of nuclear fission\r\n\r\n    Main articles: History of physics, History of nuclear weapons, and World War II\r\n\r\nThe first decades of the twentieth century led to radical changes in the understanding of the physics of the atom, including the discovery of the nucleus, the idea of radiation, and the fact that the splitting of atomic nuclei in a chain reaction could lead to massive release of energy (nuclear fission).\r\n\r\nBy 1932 the atom was thought to consist of a small, dense nucleus containing most of the atom''s mass in the form of protons and neutrons and surrounded by a shell of electrons. Study on the phenomenon of radioactivity began with the discovery of uranium ores by Henri Becquerel in 1896 and was followed by the work of Pierre and Marie Curie on radium. Their research seemed to promise that atoms, previously thought to be ultimately stable and indivisible, actually had the potential of containing and releasing immense amounts of energy. In 1919 Ernest Rutherford achieved the first artificial nuclear disintegrations by bombarding nitrogen with alpha particles emitted from a radioactive source, thus becoming the first person in history to intentionally "split the atom". It had become clear from the Curies'' work that there was a tremendous amount of energy locked up in radioactive decay ? far more than chemistry could account for. But even in the early 1930s such illustrious physicists as Ernest Rutherford and Albert Einstein could see no way of artificially releasing that energy any faster than nature naturally allowed it to leave. "Radium engines" in the 1930s were the stuff of science fiction, such as was being written at the time by Edgar Rice Burroughs. H.G. Wells included air-dropped "atomic bombs" in his 1914 novel The World Set Free. Though Wells'' "atomic bombs" bore little resemblance to actual nuclear weapons ? they were simply regular bombs that never stopped exploding ? Le? Szil?rd later commented that this story influenced his later research into this subject.\r\n\r\nProgress in controlling and understanding nuclear fission accelerated in the 1930s when further manipulation of the nuclei of atoms became possible. In 1932 Sir John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton were first to "split the atom" (cause a nuclear reaction) by using artificially accelerated particles. In 1934 Ir?ne and Fr?d?ric Joliot-Curie discovered that artificial radioactivity could be induced in stable elements by bombarding them with alpha particles. The same year Enrico Fermi reported similar results when bombarding uranium with neutrons (discovered in 1932), but he did not immediately appreciate the consequences of his results.\r\n\r\nIn December 1938 the Germans Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann published experimental results about bombarding uranium with neutrons. They showed that it produced an isotope of barium. Shortly after, their Austrian co-worker Lise Meitner (a political refugee in Sweden at the time) and her nephew Otto Robert Frisch correctly interpreted the results as the splitting of the uranium nucleus after the absorption of a neutron?nuclear fission, which released a large amount of energy and additional neutrons. A direct experimental evidence of the nuclear fission was performed by Frisch, following a fundamental idea suggested to him by George Placzek.\r\n\r\nIn 1933 Hungarian physicist Le? Szil?rd had proposed that if any neutron-driven process released more neutrons than those required to start it, an expanding nuclear chain reaction might result. Chain reactions were familiar as a phenomenon from chemistry (where they typically caused explosions and other runaway reactions), but Szil?rd was proposing them for a nuclear reaction, for the first time. However, Szil?rd had proposed to look for such reactions in the lighter atoms, and nothing of the sort was found. Upon experimentation shortly after the uranium fission discovery, Szil?rd found that the fission of uranium released two or more neutrons on average, and immediately realized that a nuclear chain reaction by this mechanism was possible in theory. Szil?rd kept this secret at first because he feared its use as a weapon by fascist governments. He convinced others to do so, but identical results were soon published by the Joliot-Curie group, to his great dismay.\r\n\r\nThat such mechanisms might have implications for civilian power or military weapons was perceived by numerous scientists in many countries, around the same time. While these developments in science were occurring, many political changes were happening in Europe. Adolf Hitler was appointed chancellor of Germany in January 1933. His anti-Semitic ideology caused all Jewish civil servants, including many physicists, to be fired from their posts. Consequently many European physicists who later made key discoveries went into exile in the United Kingdom and the United States. After Nazi Germany invaded Poland in 1939 and World War II began, many scientists in the United States and the United Kingdom became anxious about what Germany might do with nuclear technology. Albert Einstein in particular wrote several letters to Franklin Roosevelt urging him to establish nuclear capability before the Germans. These letters, especially one called the Einstein-Szil?rd letter (written in August 1939, but not personally received by Roosevelt until October 1939), were also factors in the acceleration of the project.\r\n\r\nUranium Committee (1939-1941)\r\n\r\nIn 1939, President Franklin Roosevelt called on Lyman Briggs of the National Bureau of Standards, to head "The Uranium Committee" as a result of the Einstein-Szil?rd letter. Even though Roosevelt had sanctioned the project, progress was slow and was not directed exclusively towards military applications.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the United Kingdom, refugees Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls made a breakthrough by discovering the fissile properties of uranium-235. A British committee, the MAUD Committee, concluded that an atomic bomb was "not only feasible, it was inevitable." Their reports were sent to Briggs, but were ignored. One of the members of the MAUD Committee, Mark Oliphant flew to the United States in late August 1941 to find out why the U.S. was ignoring the MAUD Committee''s findings. He reported that "this inarticulate and unimpressive man (Briggs) had put the reports in his safe and had not shown them to members of his committee."\r\n\r\nOliphant then met with the whole Uranium Committee and other physicists to galvanize the USA into action. As a result, in December 1941 Vannevar Bush created the larger and more powerful Office of Scientific Research and Development?which was empowered to engage in large engineering projects in addition to research?and became its director.\r\n\r\nAcceleration of the Project\r\nA few months after he was put in charge of fast neutron research, Berkeley physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer convened a conference on the topic of nuclear weapon design.\r\n\r\nNow that the bomb project was under the OSRD, the project leaders began to accelerate the work. Arthur Compton organized the University of Chicago Metallurgical Laboratory in early 1942 to study plutonium and fission piles (primitive nuclear reactors), and asked theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer of the University of California, Berkeley to take over research on fast neutron calculations ? key to calculations about critical mass and weapon detonation ? from Gregory Breit. John Manley, a physicist at the Metallurgical Laboratory, was assigned to help Oppenheimer find answers by coordinating and contacting several experimental physics groups scattered across the country.\r\n\r\nDuring the spring of 1942, Oppenheimer and Robert Serber of the University of Illinois worked on the problems of neutron diffusion (how neutrons moved in the chain reaction) and hydrodynamics (how the explosion produced by the chain reaction might behave). To review this work and the general theory of fission reactions, Oppenheimer convened a summer study at the University of California, Berkeley, in June 1942. Theorists Hans Bethe, John Van Vleck, Edward Teller, Felix Bloch, Emil Konopinski, Robert Serber, Stanley S. Frankel, and Eldred C. Nelson (the latter three all former students of Oppenheimer) quickly confirmed that a fission bomb was feasible. There were still many unknown factors in the development of a nuclear bomb, however, even though it was considered to be theoretically possible. The properties of pure uranium-235 were still relatively unknown, as were the properties of plutonium, a new element which had only been discovered in February 1941 by Glenn Seaborg and his team. Plutonium was the product of uranium-238 absorbing a neutron which had been emitted from a fissioning uranium-235 atom, and was thus able to be created in a nuclear reactor. But at this point no reactor had yet been built, so while plutonium was being pursued as an additional fissile substance, it was not yet to be relied upon. Only microgram quantities of plutonium existed at the time (produced from neutrons derived from reaction started in a cyclotron).\r\nA number of the different fission bomb assembly methods explored during the summer 1942 conference, later reproduced as drawings in The Los Alamos Primer. In the end, only the "gun" method (at top) and a more complicated variation of the "implosion" design would be used. At the bottom are "autocatalytic method" designs.\r\n\r\nThe scientists at the Berkeley conference determined that there were many possible ways of arranging the fissile material into a critical mass, the simplest being the shooting of a "cylindrical plug" into a sphere of "active material" with a "tamper"?dense material which would focus neutrons inward and keep the reacting mass together to increase its efficiency (this model "avoids fancy shapes", Serber would later write). They also explored designs involving spheroids, a primitive form of "implosion" (suggested by Richard C. Tolman), and explored the speculative possibility of "autocatalytic methods" which would increase the efficiency of the bomb as it exploded.\r\n\r\nConsidering the idea of the fission bomb theoretically settled -at least until more experimental data was available- the conference then turned in a different direction. Hungarian physicist Edward "Ede" Teller pushed for discussion on an even more powerful bomb: the "Super", which would use the explosive force of a detonating fission bomb to ignite a fusion reaction in deuterium and tritium. This concept was based on studies of energy production in stars made by Hans Bethe before the war, and suggested as a possibility to Teller by Enrico Fermi not long before the conference. When the detonation wave from the fission bomb moved through the mixture of deuterium and tritium nuclei, these would fuse together to produce much more energy than fission could. But Bethe was skeptical. As Teller pushed hard for his "superbomb"?now usually referred to as a "hydrogen bomb" ? proposing scheme after scheme, Bethe refuted each one. The fusion idea had to be put aside in order to concentrate on actually producing fission bombs.\r\n\r\nTeller also raised the speculative possibility that an atomic bomb might "ignite" the atmosphere, because of a hypothetical fusion reaction of nitrogen nuclei.[citation needed] Bethe calculated, according to Serber, that it could not happen. However, a report co-authored by Teller showed that ignition of the atmosphere was not impossible, just unlikely. In Serber''s account, Oppenheimer mentioned it to Arthur Compton, who "didn''t have enough sense to shut up about it. It somehow got into a document that went to Washington" which led to the question being "never laid to rest".\r\n\r\nThe conferences in the summer of 1942 provided the detailed theoretical basis for the design of the atomic bomb, and convinced Oppenheimer of the benefits of having a single centralized laboratory to manage the research for the bomb project rather than having specialists spread out at different sites across the United States.\r\n\r\nProject sites\r\n\r\nThough it involved over thirty different research and production sites, the Manhattan Project was largely carried out at three secret scientific cities that were established by power of eminent domain: Los Alamos, New Mexico, Oak Ridge, Tennessee; and Richland, Washington. The Tennessee site was chosen because of the vast quantities of cheap hydroelectric power already available there (due to the Tennessee Valley Authority) necessary to produce uranium-235 in giant ion separation magnets. The Hanford Site near Richland, Washington, was chosen for its location near the Columbia River, a river that could supply water to cool the reactors which would produce the plutonium. All the sites were suitably far from coastlines and therefore less vulnerable to possible enemy attack from Germany or Japan.\r\n\r\nThe Los Alamos National Laboratory was built on a mesa that previously hosted the Los Alamos Ranch School, a private school for teenage boys. The site was chosen primarily for its remoteness. Oppenheimer had known of it from his horse-riding near his ranch in New Mexico, and he showed it as a possible site to the government representatives, who promptly bought it for $440,000. In addition to being the main "think-tank", Los Alamos was responsible for final assembly of the bombs, mainly from materials and components produced by other sites. Manufacturing at Los Alamos included casings, explosive lenses, and fabrication of fissile materials into bomb cores.\r\n\r\nOak Ridge facilities covered more than 60,000 acres (243 km?) of several former farm communities in the Tennessee Valley area. Some Tennessee families were given two weeks'' notice to vacate family farms that had been their homes for generations.[citation needed] So secret was the site during World War II that the state governor was unaware that Oak Ridge (which was to become the fifth largest city in the state) was being built. At one point Oak Ridge plants were consuming 1/6th of the electrical power produced in the U.S., more than New York City. Oak Ridge mainly produced uranium-235.\r\n\r\nThe Hanford Site, which grew to almost 1,000 square miles (2,600 km?), took over irrigated farm land, fruit orchards, a railroad, and two farming communities, Hanford and White Bluffs, in a sparsely populated area adjacent to the Columbia River. Hanford hosted nuclear reactors cooled by the river and was the plutonium production center.\r\n\r\nThe existence of these sites and the secret cities of Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, and Richland were not made public until the announcement of the Hiroshima explosion, and the sites remained secret until after the end of WWII.\r\n\r\nThe project originally was headquartered at 270 Broadway in Manhattan. Other offices were scattered throughout the city,[8] including the New York Friars'' Club building. The Broadway headquarters lasted little more than a year before it was moved in 1943, although many of the other offices in Manhattan remained.\r\nA selection of U.S. sites important to the Manhattan Project.\r\n\r\nMajor Manhattan Project sites and subdivisions included:\r\n\r\n    * Site W (Hanford, Washington): a plutonium production facility (now Hanford Site)\r\n    * Site X (Oak Ridge, Tennessee): enriched uranium production and plutonium production research (now Oak Ridge National Laboratory) Site X also included:\r\n          o X-10 Graphite Reactor: graphite reactor research pilot plant (on the site of what is now Oak Ridge National Laboratory)\r\n          o Y-12: electromagnetic separation uranium enrichment plant\r\n          o K-25: gaseous diffusion uranium enrichment plant\r\n          o S-50: thermal diffusion uranium enrichment plant\r\n    * Site Y (Los Alamos, New Mexico): a bomb research laboratory (now Los Alamos National Laboratory)\r\n    * Metallurgical Laboratory (Chicago, Illinois): reactor development (now Argonne National Laboratory)\r\n    * Project Alberta (Wendover, Utah and Tinian): preparations for the combat delivery of the bombs\r\n    * Project Ames (Ames, Iowa): production of raw uranium metal (now Ames Laboratory)\r\n    * Dayton Project (Dayton, Ohio): research and development of polonium refinement and industrial production of polonium for atomic bomb triggers\r\n    * Project Camel (Inyokern, California): high explosives research and non-nuclear engineering for the Fat Man bomb\r\n    * Project Trinity (Alamogordo, New Mexico): preparations for the testing of the first atomic bomb\r\n    * Radiation Laboratory (Berkeley, California): electromagnetic separation enrichment research (now Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory)\r\n    * Project ''9'' (Trail, British Columbia): heavy water (deuterium) production.\r\n\r\n[edit] Need for coordination\r\n	This article or section is missing citations or needs footnotes.\r\nUsing inline citations helps guard against copyright violations and factual inaccuracies. (April 2008)\r\n\r\nThe measurements of the interactions of fast neutrons with the materials in a bomb were essential; because the scientists needed to know the number of neutrons produced in the fission of uranium and plutonium, and because the substance surrounding the nuclear material needed the ability to reflect, or scatter, neutrons back into the chain reaction before it was blown apart - this in order to increase the energy produced. Therefore, the neutron scattering properties of materials had to be measured to find the best reflectors.\r\n\r\nEstimating the explosive power required knowledge of many other nuclear properties, including the cross section (a measure of the probability of an encounter between particles that result in a specified effect) for nuclear processes of neutrons in uranium and other elements. Fast neutrons could only be produced in particle accelerators, which were still relatively uncommon instruments in 1942.\r\n\r\nThe need for better coordination was clear. By September 1942, the difficulties in conducting studies on nuclear weapons at universities scattered throughout the country indicated the need for a laboratory dedicated solely to that purpose. A greater need was the construction of industrial plants to produce uranium-235 and plutonium?the fissionable materials to be used in the weapons.\r\n\r\nVannevar Bush, the head of the civilian Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), asked President Roosevelt to assign the operations connected with the growing nuclear weapons project to the military. Roosevelt chose the Army to work with the OSRD in building production plants. The Army Corps of Engineers selected Col. James Marshall to oversee the construction of factories to separate uranium isotopes and manufacture plutonium for the bomb.\r\n\r\nMarshall and his deputy, Col. Kenneth Nichols, struggled to understand the proposed processes and the scientists with whom they had to work. Thrust into the new field of nuclear physics, they felt unable to distinguish between technical and personal preferences. Although they decided that a site near Knoxville, Tennessee, would be suitable for the first production plant, they did not know how large the site needed to be, and thus delayed its acquisition.\r\n\r\nBecause of its experimental nature, the nuclear weapons work could not compete for priority with the Army''s more urgent tasks. The scientists'' construction of the work and production plants were often delayed by Marshall''s inability to obtain critical materials -such as steel- needed in other military projects.\r\n\r\nEven selecting a name for the project was difficult. The title chosen by Gen. Brehon B. Somervell, "Development of Substitute Materials," was objectionable because it seemed to reveal too much.\r\n\r\n[edit] Manhattan Engineer District\r\nGeneral Leslie Groves (left) was appointed the military head of the Manhattan Project, while Robert Oppenheimer (right) was the scientific director.\r\n\r\nVannevar Bush became dissatisfied with Col. James Marshall''s failure to get the project moving forward expeditiously and made this known to Secretary of War Stimson and Army Chief of Staff George Marshall. Marshall then directed General Somervell to replace Col. Marshall with a more energetic officer as director. In the summer of 1942, Col. Leslie Groves was deputy to the chief of construction for the Army Corps of Engineers and had overseen the very rapid construction of the Pentagon, the world''s largest office building. He was widely respected as an intelligent, hard driving, though brusque officer who got things done in a hurry. Hoping for an overseas command, Groves vigorously objected when Somervell appointed him to the weapons project. His objections were overruled, and Groves resigned himself to leading a project he thought had little chance of success. Groves appointed Oppenheimer as the project''s scientific director, to the surprise of many. (Oppenheimer''s radical political views were thought to pose security problems). However, Groves was convinced Oppenheimer was a genius who could talk about and understand nearly anything, and he was convinced such a man was needed for a project such as the one being proposed.\r\n\r\nGroves renamed the project The Manhattan Engineer District. The name evolved from the Corps of Engineers practice of naming districts after its headquarters'' city (Marshall''s headquarters were in New York City). At that time, Groves was promoted to brigadier general, giving him the rank necessary to deal with senior people whose cooperation was required, or whose own projects were hampered by Groves'' top-priority project.\r\n\r\nWithin a week of his appointment, Groves had solved the Manhattan Project''s most urgent problems. His forceful and effective manner was soon to become all too familiar to the atomic scientists.\r\n\r\nThe first major scientific hurdle of the project was solved on December 2, 1942, beneath the bleachers of Stagg Field at the University of Chicago, where a team led by Enrico Fermi, for whom Fermilab is named, initiated the first artificial self sustaining nuclear chain reaction in an experimental nuclear reactor named Chicago Pile-1. A coded phone call from Compton saying, "The Italian navigator [referring to Fermi] has landed in the new world, the natives are friendly" to Conant in Washington, D.C., brought news of the experiment''s success.\r\n\r\n[edit] Uranium bomb\r\nA gun-type nuclear bomb.\r\n\r\nThe Hiroshima bomb, Little Boy, was made from uranium-235, a rare isotope of uranium that has to be physically separated from the more plentiful uranium-238 isotope, which is not suitable for use in an explosive device. Since U-235 is only 0.7% of raw uranium and is chemically identical to the 99.3% of U-238, various physical methods were considered for separation. Most of the uranium enrichment work was performed at Oak Ridge.\r\nControl panels and operators for calutrons at the Y-12 Plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.\r\n\r\nOne method of separating uranium 235 from raw uranium ore was devised by Franz Simon and Nicholas Kurti, two Jewish ?migr?s, at Oxford University. Their method using gaseous diffusion was scaled up in a large separation plant at Oak Ridge, using uranium hexafluoride (UF6) gas as the process fluid. During the war this method was important primarily for producing partly enriched material to feed the electromagnetic separation process undertaken in calutrons (see below).\r\n\r\nAnother method?electromagnetic isotope separation?was developed by Ernest Lawrence at the University of California Radiation Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. This method was implemented in Oak Ridge at the Y-12 Plant, employing devices known as calutrons, which were effectively mass spectrometers. Copper was originally intended for electromagnet coils, but there was an insufficient amount available due to war shortages. The project engineers were forced to borrow silver from the U.S. Treasury. A total of 70,000,000 pounds of silver from the U.S. Treasury reserves was used for coils, and was returned after the project ended. Initially the method seemed promising for large scale production but was expensive and produced insufficient material and was later abandoned after the war.\r\n\r\nOther techniques were also tried, such as thermal diffusion and the use of high-speed centrifuges. Thermal diffusion was not used to produce highly-enriched uranium, but was used during the war in the S-50 facility to begin enrichment of the uranium, and its product was passed as the feed into the other facilities.\r\n\r\nThe uranium bomb was a gun-type fission weapon. One mass of U-235, the "bullet," is fired down a more or less conventional gun barrel into another mass of U-235, rapidly creating the critical mass of U-235, resulting in an explosion. The method was so certain to work that no test was carried out before the bomb was dropped over Hiroshima, though extensive laboratory testing was undertaken to make sure the fundamental assumptions were correct. Also, the bomb dropped used all the existing extremely highly purified U-235 (and even most of the highly purified material) so there was no U-235 available for such a test anyway. The bomb''s design was known to be inefficient and prone to accidental discharge. It has been estimated that only about 15% of the fissile material went critical.[citation needed]\r\n\r\n[edit] Plutonium bomb\r\n	This article may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia''s quality standards.\r\nPlease improve this article if you can. (October 2008)\r\nThe basic concept of an implosion-style nuclear weapon. Actual pictures and details of the bomb''s inner workings remain classified.\r\n\r\nThe bombs used in the first test at Trinity Site on July 16, 1945, in New Mexico (the gadget of the Trinity test), and in the Nagasaki bomb, Fat Man, were made primarily of plutonium-239, a synthetic element.\r\n\r\nAlthough uranium-238 is useless as a fissile isotope for an atomic bomb, it is key in producing plutonium. The fission of U-235 releases neutrons, which are absorbed by U-238, which then becomes uranium-239. U-239 rapidly decays to neptunium-239 (U-239 has a half-life 23.45 minutes). Neptunium-239 (with a half-life 2.35 days) then decays into plutonium-239. The production and purification of plutonium used techniques developed in part by Glenn Seaborg while working at Berkeley and Chicago. Beginning in 1943, huge plants were built to produce plutonium at the Hanford Site.\r\nA mock-up of the plutonium bomb, Fat Man\r\n\r\nIn 1943?1944, development efforts were directed to a gun-type fission weapon with plutonium, called "Thin Man". Once this was achieved, the scientists thought the uranium version, "Little Boy," would require a relatively simple adaptation.\r\n\r\nInitial research on the properties of plutonium was done using cyclotron-generated plutonium-239, which was extremely pure, but could only be created in very small amounts. On April 5, 1944, Emilio Segr? at Los Alamos received the first sample of Hanford-produced plutonium. Within ten days, he discovered a fatal flaw: reactor-bred plutonium was far less isotopically pure than cyclotron-produced plutonium. A higher concentration of Pu-240, formed from Pu-239 by capture of an additional neutron, gave it a much higher spontaneous fission rate than U-235. Pu-240 was even harder to separate from Pu-239 than U-235 was to separate from U-238, so no purification was even attempted. This made the Hanford plutonium unsuitable for use in a gun-type weapon.\r\n\r\nThe gun-type bomb worked by mechanically assembling the critical mass from two subcritical masses: a "bullet" and a target. The chain reaction resulting from collision of the "bullet" with the target released tremendous energy, producing an explosion, but also blew apart the critical mass and ended the chain reaction. The configuration of the critical mass determined how much of the fissile material reacted in the interval between assembly and dispersal, and therefore the explosive yield of the bomb. (The chain reaction actually starts before complete assembly of the critical mass.) Even a 1% fission of the material would result in a workable bomb, equal to thousands of tons of high explosive. A poor configuration, or slow assembly, would release enough energy to disperse the critical mass, but too quickly. Far less than 1% would react, and the yield would be equivalent to only a few tons of HE - a fizzle.\r\n\r\nThe chain reaction of U-235 was slow enough that gun-type assembly would work. But suppose a gun-type bomb was made with the Hanford plutonium? As the critical mass comes together, "early" neutrons from spontaneously fissioning Pu-240 start the chain reaction prematurely. This releases enough energy to disperse the critical mass with only a minimal amount of plutonium reacted. In plain English, a gun-type plutonium bomb fizzles.\r\n\r\nIn an incident of disruptive technology, Oppenheimer promptly recognized that the April 1944 suggestion by James L. Tuck to use explosive lenses to create a spherical converging implosion waves was the best strategy to rapidly achieve a working plutonium device. He promptly canceled ongoing work in order to reallocate resources in that new direction. This then-new idea remains a mainstay of nuclear weapon design.\r\n\r\nIn July 1944, the decision was made to cease work on the plutonium gun method. There would be no "Thin Man." The gun method was further developed for uranium only, which had few complications. Most efforts were then directed to a different method for plutonium.\r\nIn July 1944 the Los Alamos laboratory abandoned the plutonium gun-type bomb ("Thin Man", shown above) and focused almost entirely on the problem of implosion. (The Fat Man casing is also visible in the photo background.)\r\n\r\nIdeas for alternative detonation schemes had existed for some time at Los Alamos. One of the more innovative was the idea of "implosion". Using chemical explosives, a sub-critical sphere of fissile material could be squeezed into a smaller and denser form. When the fissile atoms were packed closer together, the rate of neutron capture would increase, and the mass would become a critical mass. The metal needed to travel only very short distances, so the critical mass would be assembled in much less time than it would take to assemble a mass by a bullet impacting a target.\r\n\r\nInitially, implosion had been entertained as a possible, though unlikely, method. But then Emilio Segr? discovered that a gun-type bomb using reactor-bred plutonium could not work. Uranium-235 production could not be substantially increased. The plutonium implosion bomb was the only practical solution for production of multiple bombs from the available fissionable material. Because of this, the implosion project received the highest priority. By the end of July 1944, the entire Manhattan Project had been reorganized around building the implosion-type bomb.\r\n\r\nThe required implosion was achieved by using shaped charges with many explosive lenses to produce the perfectly spherical explosive wave which compressed the plutonium sphere.\r\n\r\nBecause of the complexity of an implosion-style weapon, it was decided that, despite the waste of fissile material, an initial test would be required. The first nuclear test took place on July 16, 1945, near Alamogordo, New Mexico, under the supervision of Groves''s deputy Brig. Gen. Thomas Farrell. Oppenheimer gave the test the code name "Trinity".\r\n\r\nSimilar efforts\r\n\r\nA similar effort was undertaken in the USSR in September 1941 headed by Igor Kurchatov (with some of Kurchatov''s World War II knowledge coming secondhand from Manhattan Project countries, thanks to spies, including at least two on the scientific team at Los Alamos, Klaus Fuchs and Theodore Hall, unknown to each other).\r\n\r\nAfter the MAUD Committee''s report, the British and Americans exchanged nuclear information but initially did not pool their efforts. A British project, code-named Tube Alloys, was started but did not have United States resources. Consequently the British bargaining position worsened, and their motives were mistrusted by the Americans. Collaboration therefore lessened markedly until the Quebec Agreement of August 1943, when a large team of British, Canadian and Australian scientists joined the Manhattan Project.\r\nThe German experimental nuclear pile at Haigerloch\r\n\r\nThe question of Axis efforts on the bomb has been a contentious issue for historians. It is believed that efforts undertaken in Germany, headed by Werner Heisenberg, and in Japan, were also undertaken during the war with little progress. It was initially feared that Hitler was very close to developing his own bomb. Many German scientists in fact expressed surprise to their Allied captors when the bombs were detonated in Japan. They were convinced that talk of atomic weapons was merely propaganda. However, Werner Heisenberg (by then imprisoned in Britain at Farm Hall with several other nuclear project physicists) almost immediately figured out what the Allies had done, explaining it to his fellow scientists (and hidden microphones) within days. The Nazi reactor effort had been severely handicapped by Heisenberg''s belief that heavy water was necessary as a neutron moderator (slowing preparation material) for such a device. The Germans were short of heavy water throughout the war because of Allied efforts to prevent Germany from obtaining it, and the Germans never did stumble on the secret of purified graphite for making nuclear reactors from natural uranium.\r\n\r\nBohr, Heisenberg and Fermi were all colleagues who were key figures in developing the quantum theory together with Wolfgang Pauli, prior to the war. They had known each other well in Europe and were friends. Niels Bohr and Heisenberg even discussed the possibility of the atomic bomb prior to and during the war, before the United States became involved. Bohr recalled that Heisenberg was unaware that the supercritical mass could be achieved with U-235, and both men gave differing accounts of their conversations at this sensitive time. Bohr at the time did not trust Heisenberg, and never quite forgave him for his decision not to flee Germany before the war when given the chance. Heisenberg, for his part, seems to have thought he was proposing to Bohr a mutual agreement between the two sides not to pursue nuclear technology for destructive purposes. If so, Heisenberg''s message did not get through. Heisenberg, to the end of his life, maintained that the partly-built German heavy-water nuclear reactor found after the war''s end in his lab was for research purposes only, and a full bomb project had not been contemplated (there is no evidence to contradict this, but by this time late in the war, Germany was far from having the resources for a Hanford-style plutonium bomb, even if its scientists had decided to pursue one and had known how to do it).\r\n\r\n\r\nWorld War II series\r\nv ? d ? e\r\nPrecursors\r\nAsian events  ?

INSERT INTO `wiki` VALUES (43, 'Majestic 12', 'Majestic 12 (also known as Majic 12, Majestic Trust, M12, MJ 12, MJ XII or Majority 12) is the purported code name of a secret committee of scientists, military leaders, and government officials, supposedly formed in 1947 by an executive order of U.S. President Harry S. Truman. The purpose of the committee was to investigate UFO activity in the aftermath of the Roswell incident - the purported crash of an alien spaceship near Roswell, New Mexico, in July 1947.

The original MJ-12 documents state that:\r\n\r\n    The Majestic 12 group... was established by order of President Truman on 24 September, [sic - see discussion] 1947, upon recommendation by Dr. Vannevar Bush and Secretary of Defense James Forrestal.\r\n\r\nThe existence of MJ-12 has sometimes been denied by some agencies of the United States government, which insist that documents suggesting its existence are hoaxes. The FBI investigated the documents, and concluded they were forgeries, based primarily on an opinion rendered by AFOSI, the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations. Opinions among UFO researchers are divided: Some argue the documents may be genuine while others contend they are phony, primarily due to errors in formatting and chronology.\r\n\r\nIn 1985, another document mentioning MJ-12 and dating to 1954 was found in a search at the National Archives. Its authenticity is also highly controversial. The documents in question are rather widely available on the Internet, for example on the FBI website, where they are dismissed as bogus (linked below).\r\n\r\nSince the first MJ-12 documents, thousands of pages of other supposed leaked government documents mentioning MJ-12 and a government coverup of UFO reality have also appeared, sometimes collectively referred to as the "Majestic Documents." All of them are controversial, with many disputing their authenticity. A few have been proven to be unquestionably fraudulent, usually retyped rewrites of unrelated government documents. The primary new MJ-12 document is a lengthy, linotype-set manual allegedly dating from 1954, called the MJ-12 "Special Operations Manual (SOM)". It deals primarily with the handling of crash debris and alien bodies.Objections to its authenticity usually center on questions of style and some historical anachronisms.\r\n\r\nThe documents date from 1942 to 1997 and have been hotly debated in the UFO community. The documents include such matters as the conduct to be used when meeting an alien, diagrams and records of tests on UFOs, memos on assorted coverups, and descriptions of the President''s statements about UFO-related issues. The documents contain supposed signatures of important people such as Albert Einstein and Ronald Reagan, creating a major debate in the conspiracy and UFO communities. No more documents have been leaked or released since 1997. Their authenticity remains uncertain, and some claim them to be entirely fake.\r\n\r\nHowever, before the appearance of the various dubious MJ-12 documents, Canadian documents dating from 1950 and 1951 were uncovered in 1978. These documents mention the existence of a similar, highly classified UFO study group operating within the Pentagon''s Research & Development Board (RDB) and headed by Dr. Vannevar Bush. Although the name of the group is not given, proponents argue that these documents remain the most compelling evidence that such a group did exist. There is also some testimony (see Arguments for below) from a few government scientists involved with this project confirming its existence.\r\n\r\nOther theories of the MJ-12 group\r\n\r\nMJ-12 is sometimes associated[citation needed] in recent UFO conspiracy literature with the more historically verifiable but also deeply secretive NSC 5412/2 Special Group, created by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1954. Although the Special Group was not specifically concerned with UFOs, and post-dates the alleged creation of MJ-12 in 1947, the commonality of the number ''12'' in the names of the two groups is cited as intriguing, as is the first chairman, Gordon Gray, being one of the alleged MJ-12 members. As the highest body of central intelligence experts in the early Cold War era (the Group was alleged to include the President but exclude the Vice President), the Special Group certainly would have had both clearance and interest in all matters of national security, including UFO sightings if they were considered a real threat.\r\n\r\nOthers have speculated that MJ-12 may have been another name for the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit, an officially recognized UFO-related military group active from the 1940s through the late 1950s.\r\n\r\nAnother government group recently associated with MJ-12 was the CIA''s Office of National Estimates or ONE, a forerunner of the current National Intelligence Council (NIC). ONE was created in 1950 by CIA Director Gen. Walter Bedell Smith, alleged to have replaced Secretary of Defense James Forrestal on MJ-12 after his death. A history of the NIC states that ONE was a type of super branch of the CIA "whose sole task was to produce coordinated ''National Intelligence Estimates.''"\r\nBesides Smith, it apparently consisted of 11 other members. A recent article on the history of the CIA''s involvement in UFO investigations states that ONE received a UFO intelligence briefing on January 30, 1953, immediately after the end of the CIA''s UFO debunking study known as the Robertson Panel. Members of ONE at that time included FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, William Bundy, President Eisenhower''s chief of staff Admiral B. Bieri, and William Langer, a Harvard historian, who was chairman. Referring to ONE as "super think tank" within the CIA, the article states, "ONE is as close as we get to a documented version of the rumoured Majestic-12 group."\r\n\r\nConnection to the secret Pratt documents\r\n\r\nAt the Mutual UFO Network or MUFON 2007 Symposium in Denver Colorado, UFO researcher Brad Sparks presented a paper that describes the MJ12 documents as an elaborate disinformation campaign perpetrated by William Moore, Richard C. Doty, and other Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) personnel. The sources for this information are files dating from 1981 (3 years before the first alleged MJ12 documents surfaced) that UFO researcher Bob Pratt gave MUFON before his death in 2005. The information lay hidden in MUFON''s archives until they were digitized as part of MUFON''s Pandora Project and made available to UFO researchers. The paper can be downloaded from the following reference.\r\n\r\nMUFON has made the Pratt documents available online. Of interest will be the paragraph that has a handwritten date of 1/02/82 and states: "3. UFO project is Aquarius, classified Top Secret with access restricted to MJ 12. (MJ may be "magic"). This project begun about 1966, but apparently inherited files of earlier project."\r\n\r\nThe significance of this paragraph is that it ties MJ12 to the Aquarius document, a known fabricated document, that alleges that Jesus Christ was an alien.\r\n\r\n[edit] Membership\r\n\r\nAll the alleged original members of MJ-12 were notable for their military, government, and/or scientific achievements, and all were deceased when the documents first surfaced (the last to die was Jerome Hunsaker, only a few months before the MJ-12 papers first appeared).\r\n\r\nThe original composition was six civilians (mostly scientists), and six high-ranking military officers, two from each major military service. Three (Souers, Vandenberg, and Hillenkoetter) had been the first three heads of central intelligence. The Moore/Shandera documents did not make clear who was the director of MJ-12, or if there was any organizational hierarchy.\r\n\r\nThe named members of MJ-12 were:\r\n\r\n    * Rear Adm. Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter: first CIA director\r\n    * Dr. Vannevar Bush: chaired wartime Office of Scientific Research and Development and predecessor National Defense Research Committee; set up and chaired postwar Joint Research and Development Board (JRDB) and then the Research and Development Board (RDB); chaired NACA; President of Carnegie Institute, Washington D.C.\r\n    * James Forrestal: Secretary of the Navy; first Secretary of Defense (replaced after his death on MJ-12 by Gen. Walter Bedell Smith, 2nd CIA director)\r\n    * Gen. Nathan Twining: headed Air Materiel Command at Wright-Patterson AFB; Air Force Chief of Staff (1953-1957); Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff (1957-1961)\r\n    * Gen.

Later as Air Force Chief of Staff, both Vandenberg and Twining oversaw early U.S. Air Force UFO investigations, like Project Sign and Project Blue Book and made some public statements on UFOs.\r\n    * Twining had previously written a famous Secret memo on September 23, 1947 (the day before Truman allegedly set up MJ-12) stating that flying saucers were real and urged formal investigation by multiple government organizations such as the AEC, NACA, NEPA, Bush''s JRDB, and the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board. This led directly to the creation of Project Sign in late 1947.\r\n    * Vandenberg met with Bush''s JRDB in a suddenly-called meeting on the morning of the Roswell UFO incident (July 8, 1947) and was reported in the press as handling the later public relations crises.\r\n    * Bush was directly implicated in 1950-51 Canadian documents heading a highly secret UFO investigation within the Research and Development Board (RDB); this assertion was confirmed by Canadian scientist Wilbert B. Smith Immediately after the Roswell UFO incident, Bush made public statements denying any knowledge of UFOs or any relation they might have to secret government projects.\r\n    * Berkner was on the 1953 CIA-organized Robertson Panel debunking UFOs and helped establish Project Ozma, the first radio telescope search for extraterrestrial intelligence.\r\n    * Menzel filed a UFO report in 1949, later wrote several UFO debunking books, and was the most prominent public UFO debunker of his time. Many conspiracy theorists see this as a "cover-up" for alleged MJ12 - alien connections.\r\n    * Hillenkoetter was on the board of directors of the powerful civilian UFO organization NICAP and made public statements to Congress about UFO reality in 1960.\r\n    * The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), which Hunsaker chaired from 1941-1958, is also known from documents to have occasionally delved into UFO cases. Other members of NACA were Bush (1938-1948), Compton (1948-1949), Vandenberg (1948-1953), Twining (1953-1957), and Bronk (1948-1958).\r\n    * Teller was a member of a scientific panel in 1949 at Los Alamos National Laboratory looking into the UFO phenomenon known as the green fireballs\r\n\r\nProfessional and social connections between purported MJ-12 members\r\n\r\nResearch has also shown that there were many social and professional connections between many of the alleged members of MJ-12. For example, Bush, Hunsaker, Bronk, and Berkner all sat on the oversight committee of the Research and Development Board (RDB), which Bush had established and initially chaired. Other notables on the RDB oversight committee were Karl Compton, Robert Oppenheimer, and Dr. H. P. Robertson, who headed up the debunking Robertson Panel, of which Berkner was a member. As mentioned, 1950 Canadian documents indicated that Bush headed up a small, highly secret UFO study group within the RDB. (See also Arguments for below)\r\n\r\nVarious alleged MJ-12 members or participants would also naturally be part of the Presidential office''s National Security Council, created in 1947. This would include (depending on NSC composition, which evolved) various NSC permanent members: Executive Secretary (Souers, Cutler), the Secretary of Defense (Forrestal), the Secretary of the Army (Gray), National Security Advisor (Gray), and the Air Force Chief of Staff (Vandenberg, Twining). Other nonpermanent members who would attend NSC meetings as advisors and implement policy would be the CIA director (Hillenkoetter, Smith), the head of the Research and Development Board (Bush, Compton), the President''s Special Assistant for National Security Affairs (Cutler, Gray), and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs (Twining).\r\n\r\nTherefore the supposed members and participating personnel of MJ-12 would have served on many other high government agencies and could conceivably have influenced government policy at many levels. (See also list of supposed current MJ-12 members below, again indicating various individuals who have served in high government positions.)\r\n\r\nThe purported members were trusted, high-ranking officials who were often involved in important government projects?they possessed diverse skills and high security clearances. However, they were not so recognizable that they would be missed if they were to be called upon in a secret emergency. If such a group existed, these individuals would make plausible members.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n\r\nThe history of the MJ-12 papers is highly complex, with a series of often-confusing assertions, counterassertions and debates. It always seems as a mystery.\r\n\r\nArthur Bray''s discovery (1978)\r\n\r\nIn 1978 Canadian researcher Arthur Bray uncovered previously-classified Canadian UFO documents naming Dr. Vannevar Bush as heading a highly secret UFO investigation group within the U.S. Research and Development Board. No name for the group was given. Bray published excerpts of the documents in his 1979 book, The UFO Connection..\r\n\r\nAquarius document and Paul Bennewitz connection (1980)\r\n\r\nThe earliest citation of the term "MJ Twelve" originally surfaced in a purported U.S. Air Force teletype dated November 17, 1980. This so-called "Project Aquarius" teletype had been given to Albuquerque physicist and businessman Paul Bennewitz in November, 1980, by U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations counterintelligence officer Richard C. Doty as part of a disinformation campaign to discredit Bennewitz. Bennewitz had photographed and recorded electronic data of what he believed to be UFO activity over and nearby Kirtland AFB, a sensitive nuclear facility, which he had reported to officials at Kirtland, including Doty. Later it was discovered the Aquarius document was phony and had been prepared by Doty.\r\n\r\nOne sentence in the lengthy teletype read:\r\n\r\n    The official US Government policy and results of Project Aquarius is [sic] still classified TOP SECRET with no dissemination outside channels and with access restricted to "MJ TWELVE."\r\n\r\nAs Greg Bishop writes, "Here, near the bottom of this wordy message in late 1980, was the very first time anyone had seen a reference to the idea of a suspected government group called ''MJ Twelve'' that controlled UFO information. Of course, no one suspected at the time the colossal role that this idea would play in 1980s and ''90s UFOlogy, and it eventually spread beyond its confines to become a cultural mainstay."\r\n\r\nAs Bennewitz was the subject of a disinformation campaign, many investigators are automatically suspicious of any documents or claims made in association with the Bennewitz affair. Because the entire MJ-12 affair made its appearance only a year after Bray had made public the incriminating Canadian documents about the secret UFO committee, one theory[citation needed] is that the Project Aquarius teletype was part of a counterintelligence hoax to discredit the information in the just-revealed Canadian documents. Thus the various MJ-12 documents could be fake, but the secret committee described in the verified Canadian documents could still have been real. (See Arguments for below)\r\n\r\nThe Moore/Shandera documents (1984)\r\n\r\nWhat came to be known as the "MJ-12 papers" ? detailing a secret UFO committee allegedly involving Vannevar Bush ? first appeared on a roll of film in late 1984 in the mailbox of television documentary producer (and amateur ufologist) Jamie Shandera. Shandera had been collaborating with Roswell researcher William Moore since 1982.\r\n\r\nJust prior to Bennewitz and the Aquarius document, Moore had been contacted in September 1980 by Doty, who described himself as representing a shadowy group of 10 military intelligence insiders who claimed to be opposed to UFO secrecy. Moore called them "The Aviary".\r\n\r\nIn January 1981, Doty provided Moore with a copy of the phony Aquarius document with mention of MJ Twelve. Moore would later claim in 1989 that he began collaborating with AFOSI in spying on fellow researchers such as Bennewitz, and dispensing disinformation, ostensibly to gain the trust of the military officers, but reality to learn whatever UFO truth they might have, and also to learn how the military manipulated UFO researchers. In return, Doty and others were to leak information to him.\r\n\r\nLater it would turn out that some of the UFO documents given Moore were genuine[citation needed], but others were forged by Doty and compatriots, or were retyped and altered from the originals. Furthermore, the film mailed Shandera with the MJ-12 documents was postmarked "Albuquerque," raising the obvious suspicion that the MJ-12 documents were more bogus documents arising from Doty and AFOSI in Albuquerque.\r\n\r\nIn 1983, Doty also targeted UFO researcher and journalist Linda Moulton Howe, revealing alleged high-level UFO documents, including those describing crashed alien flying saucers and recovery of aliens. Doty again mentioned MJ-12, explaining that ?MJ? stood for ?Majority? (not ?Majestic?)\r\n\r\nMoore soon showed a copy of the Aquarius/MJ 12 teletype given him by Doty to researchers Brad Sparks and Kal Korff. In 1983, Moore also sought Sparks'' reaction to a plan to create counterfeit government UFO documents, hoping to induce former military officers to speak out. Sparks strongly urged Moore not do this. The previous year Moore had similarly approached nuclear physicist and UFO researcher Stanton T. Friedman about creating bogus Roswell documents, again with the idea of encouraging witnesses to come forward. Also, in early 1982, Moore had approached former National Enquirer reporter Bob Pratt (who had first published a story on Roswell in the Enquirer in 1980). Moore asked Pratt to collaborate on novel called MAJIK-12. As a result, Pratt always believed that the Majestic-12 papers were a hoax, either perpetrated personally by Moore or perhaps by AFOSI, with Doty using Moore as a willing target. Moore, however, flatly denied creating the documents, but eventually thought that maybe he had been set up. Noted UFO skeptic Philip J. Klass would also argue that Moore was the most likely hoaxer of the initial batch of MJ-12 documents.\r\n\r\nUnlike Pratt, who was convinced they were a hoax, Friedman would investigate the historical and technical details in the MJ-12 documents and become their staunchest defender.\r\n\r\nThe 1984/1985 MJ-12 Papers\r\n\r\n The Eisenhower briefing document\r\n\r\nThe film received by Shandera in 1984 consisted of two MJ-12 documents. The main document, dated November 18, 1952, was supposedly prepared by Rear Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter, the first CIA director, to brief incoming president Dwight Eisenhower on the committee''s progress. The document lists all the MJ-12 members and discusses United States Air Force investigations and concealment of a crashed alien spacecraft near Roswell, New Mexico, plus another crash in northern Mexico in December 1950.\r\n\r\nEisenhower did indeed receive extensive briefings November 18, 1952,including a briefing at the Pentagon by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which would have included alleged MJ-12 members Twining and Vandenberg. However, Eisenhower?s Pentagon briefing is still classified and thus the subject matter discussed remains speculative.\r\n\r\nThe Truman memo\r\n\r\nAn attached document of one page, dated September 24, 1947, was supposedly written by President Harry Truman, addressed to Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, authorizing the formation of the group "Operation Majestic Twelve". In it, Truman stated he wanted ultimate decision-making power to reside with the Office of the President, after consultation with Forrestal, Hillenkoetter, and Dr. Vannevar Bush.\r\n\r\nOne historical detail that perhaps supports the Truman memo''s favor was that this was the only date on which both Forrestal and Bush met with Truman. (It is also the day after Gen. Twining wrote a Secret memo saying flying saucers were real and urged an extensive investigation by multiple government agencies[citation needed]).\r\n\r\nWhile this doesn?t prove authenticity, it would suggest that if the documents were hoaxed, the hoaxer(s) had conducted considerable research. Also, according to contemporary newspapers the Forrestal/Bush/Truman meeting concerned Bush being appointed by Truman as chairman of the new Defense Department Research and Development Board under Forrestal''s direction. The appointment was made official the following day and Forrestal swore Bush into the post a week later.\r\n\r\nThe Cutler/Twining memo (1985)\r\n\r\nIn 1985, Shandera and Moore began receiving post cards postmarked ?New Zealand? with a return address of "Box 189, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia." The cards contained a series of cryptic messages referring to "Reeses [sic] Pieces" and "Suitland" (among other terms) that Shandera and Moore assumed were a code; however, they were unable to "decode" the seeming message.\r\n\r\nA few months later, a happenstance request from Friedman unlocked the mystery: busy due to previous obligations, Friedman asked Moore and Shandera to examine newly declassified Air Force documents at the National Archives (NARA) repository in Suitland, Maryland; the head archivist there was named Ed Reese.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days in Suitland, Shandera and Moore discovered yet another MJ-12 document, the so-called Cutler/Twining memo, dated July 14, 1954. Interestingly enough, the memo turned up in "Box 189" of the record group. In this memo, NSC Executive Secretary and Eisenhower?s National Security Advisor Robert Cutler informed Air Force Chief of Staff (and alleged MJ-12 member) Nathan Twining of a change of plans in a scheduled MJ-12 briefing.\r\n\r\nThe Cutler-Twining memo lacked a distinctive catalog number, leading many to suspect that whether hoaxed or genuine, the memo was almost certainly planted in the archives.\r\n\r\nMoore and Shandera have been accused[citation needed] of hoaxing the memo and then planting it in the archives. However, Friedman notes that the memo, unlike the other early MJ-12 papers which were available only as photos, is on original onionskin paper widely used by the government at that time. It also has some subtle historical and other details that a civilian hoaxer would be unlikely to know, such as a red pencil declassification marking also found with the other declassified files. Furthermore, NARA security procedures would make it difficult for a visitor to the Archives to plant such a document; even the skeptical Klass argued that NARA security procedures made it highly unlikely that Shandera and Moore could have planted the Cutler-Twining memo in the archives. Instead, Friedman has argued that one of the many Air Force personnel involved in declassifying NARA documents could easily have planted the Cutler/Twining memo in with other unrelated documents.\r\n\r\nHowever, most researchers have argued[citation needed] that various subtle details point to a forgery (see #Arguments against for some). However, this doesn?t negate Friedman?s point that the memo could have been planted by someone in the Air Force). For example, the date of the alleged MJ-12 meeting does not correspond to any known meeting of import.\r\n\r\nThe FBI investigation\r\n\r\nThe MJ-12 documents were first made public in 1987 by Shandera, Moore, and Friedman. Another copy of the same documents Shandera received in 1984 was mailed to British researcher Timothy Good in 1987, again from an anonymous source. Good first reproduced them in his best-selling book Above Top Secret (1988), but later disowned the documents as likely fraudulent.\r\n\r\nAfter the documents became widely known with the publication of Good?s book, the Federal Bureau of Investigations then began its own investigation, urged on by debunker Philip J. Klass. The MJ-12 documents were supposedly classified as "Top Secret", and the FBI''s initial concern was that someone within the U.S. government had illegally leaked highly classified information.\r\n\r\nThe FBI quickly formed doubts as to the documents'' authenticity. FBI personnel contacted the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations (counterintelligence), asking if MJ-12 had ever existed. AFOSI claimed that no such committee had ever been authorized or formed, and that the documents were ?bogus.? The FBI adopted the AFOSI opinion and the FBI?s official position became that the MJ-12 documents were "completely bogus.?\r\n\r\nHowever, when Stanton Friedman contacted the AFOSI officer, Col. Richard Weaver, who had rendered this opinion, Friedman said Weaver refused to document his assertion. Friedman also noted that Weaver had taught disinformation and propaganda courses for AFOSI and was principal author of the Air Force?s debunking Roswell report in 1994. (Friedman, 110-115)\r\n\r\nTimothy Good in Beyond Top Secret also noted that Weaver in 1994 was the Director of Security and Special Programs Oversight of AFOSI?s Pentagon office, a very high level organization within the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force. Good commented that AFOSI is ?an agency whose work involves counterintelligence and deception, and which has a long record of deep involvement in the UFO problem.? Within Weaver?s office were ?special planners.? According to Good, ?In Air Force parlance, the term ?special plans? is a euphemism for deception as well as for ?perception management? plans and operations.? Conducting an interview with one Roswell witness, Weaver himself admitted, ?We?re the people who keep the secrets.? It is difficult to tell from interviews such as these, as the cold war tactics of deceptions within deceptions are intentionally vague as to where the disinformation and coverup of espionage ends and the government''s actual investigation into UFOs begins.\r\n\r\nWilliam Moore would later reveal that the whole New Mexico UFO disinformation scheme was run out of the Pentagon by a Colonel Barry Hennessey of AFOSI. When the Defense Department phone directory was checked, Hennessey was listed under the "Dept. of Special Techniques." Working under him at the time was the same Col. Weaver.\r\n\r\nFriedman therefore raised the question as to whether Weaver rendered an objective intelligence opinion about the authenticity of the MJ-12 papers or was deliberately misleading the FBI as a counterintelligence and disinformation agent, much like Doty had done with Moore and Howe earlier.\r\n\r\nJournalist Howard Blum in his book Out There (1990) further described the FBI?s difficulty in getting at the truth of the matter. One frustrated FBI agent told Blum, ?All we?re finding out is that the government doesn?t know what it knows. There are too many secret levels. You can?t get a straight story. It wouldn?t surprise me if we never know if the papers are genuine or not.?\r\n\r\nArguments for\r\n\r\n    * The National Archives contain one document relating to MJ-12, found in 1985, which has been interpreted as corroborative evidence for the MJ-12 documents being genuine:\r\n\r\n    "Memorandum for General Twining, from Robert Cutler, Special Assistant to the President, Subject: "NSC/MJ-12 Special Studies Project" dated July 14, 1954. The memo''s advised Twining of a change of scheduling for a planned briefing following an already scheduled, unspecified "White House meeting" on July 16. Cutler was Eisenhower''s National Security Adviser. The memorandum does not identify MJ-12 or the purpose of the briefing (see links). However, arguments have been made against this document''s authenticity; see below.\r\n\r\n    * Regarding the Cutler memo, Jim Speiser writes, "The alleged maker of the memo, Robert Cutler, was out of the country when it was typed. Researchers counter that Cutler''s assistants, James Lay and Patrick Coyne, routinely sent out memos under Cutler''s name, and they point to the fact that the memo (extant now in carbon copy only) is unsigned." Stanton Friedman has argued that if the memo had the absent Cutler''s signature on it, it would have proven that it was a hoax. Thus the absence of signature instead supports its authenticity.\r\n\r\n    * Nuclear physicist and UFO researcher Stanton Friedman has offered other rebuttal of many arguments against the documents'' authenticity. For example, Philip J. Klass suggested that the Cutler/Twining memo was fraudulent, because it was typed in the Pica font, while Klass insisted that genuine White House documents of that era were only typed in Elite. Klass offered $100 for every example of genuine Pica font that could be presented. Friedman responded, as Speiser wrote in the same article cited above, "Friedman provides no fewer than 20 such exemplars, more than enough to win the maximum prize." (Klass paid him $1000, though Speiser suggests the challenge might more accurately be called a draw: "Klass'' letter specifically called for ''letters'' and ''memoranda''; Friedman provides only headings and dates in his initial response.) Some other Friedman objections to Klass'' arguments are provided further below.\r\n\r\n    * Perhaps weakly corroborating the authenticity of the Cutler memo was a column written by journalist Dorothy Kilgallen on February 15, 1954, in which she stated, "Flying saucers are regarded as of such vital importance they will be the subject of a special hush-hush meeting of world military heads next summer."\r\n\r\n    * Citing work by Timothy Good, C.D.B. Bryan notes the existence of a secret memorandum written by Canadian radio engineer Wilbert B. Smith, who had long worked for the Canadian Department of Transportation. Dated November 21, 1950, the memo recommended that the Canadian government establish a formal investigation of UFOs (Project Magnet was this study). In part, Smith wrote that his own "discreet inquiries" through the Canadian embassy in Washington D.C. had uncovered the fact that "flying saucers exist", "the matter is the most highly classified subject in the United States Government, rating higher even than the H-bomb", and that "concentrated effort is being made by a small group headed by Doctor Vannevar Bush" into their "modus operandi" (Bryan, 186) Smith''s memo was authenticated by the Canadian government. Good concluded that this document is a major argument in favor of MJ-12''s reality. Additional documents from Smith and the Canadian embassy named Bush and the Research and Development Board (RDB) as being needed to clear a magazine article being written by Donald Keyhoe on Smith''s flying saucer theories.[30] Smith also made some public statements about being loaned UFO crash material for metallurgical analysis by some "highly classified group" which he would not name, but indicated it was not the Air Force or CIA.\r\n\r\n    * In a letter from 1983, Dr. Omond Solandt, director of the Canadian Defence Research Board (DRB), who had approved Smith''s initial UFO study and lent support from the DRB (according to Smith''s memo), confirmed meeting with Bush on a regular but "informal" basis to discuss flying saucers and Smith''s UFO work.\r\n\r\n    * Smith''s primary source in 1950 was Dr. Robert Sarbacher, a missile and electronics expert and a consultant for the RDB''s guided missile committee. When contacted again in 1983 by William Steinman, Sarbacher in a letter confirmed having the 1950 meeting, reconfirmed that Bush and the RDB were definitely involved, added that mathematician John von Neumann was also definitely involved and he thought Dr. Robert Oppenheimer as well. He also reconfirmed that there had been flying saucer crashes and being told that the material recovered was extremely lightweight and strong. He was told about small alien bodies.\r\n\r\n    * In later interviews, Sarbacher would also implicate electrical engineer Dr. Eric A. Walker, the executive secretary of the RDB from 1950-1951 and later President of Penn State University. Walker was contacted by phone in 1987 by Steinman. He was asked first whether he had attended meetings at Wright-Patterson AFB concerning the military recovery of flying saucers and bodies of occupants. According to Steinman, he responded, "Yes, I attended meetings concerning that subject matter." When asked as to whether he knew about MJ-12, he responded, "Yes, I know of MJ-12. I have known of them for 40 years." In subsequent interviews and correspondence by other researchers, Walker became much more evasive. But in two interviews from 1990, Walker, while saying he thought the MJ-12 documents were not authentic, also admitted he had had nothing do with MJ-12 "for a long time" but they still existed and were "a handful of elite", no longer military, and no longer all American. "We have learnt so much, and we are not working with them, only contact. The technology is far beyond what is known in ordinary terms of physics."\r\n\r\n    * Another person to implicate Bush and Walker as likely being involved was Dr. Fred Darwin, who had been Executive Director for the Guided Missile Committee for the RDB from 1949 to 1954, to which both Sarbacher and Walker acted as consultants. Like Sarbacher, Darwin also suggested John von Neumann, and added alleged MJ-12 member Lloyd Berkner and physicist Dr. Karl Compton.\r\n\r\n    * Following a famous close encounter with a 300-foot flying saucer while flying from Iceland to Newfoundland on February 10, 1951 , Naval Reserve pilot Commander Graham Bethune relates that he and the entire crew were immediately debriefed by USAF and Naval intelligence. In May 1951, Bethune was again questioned by a Naval intelligence officer. Bethune says he then asked the officer where such reports ended up. He responded that they first went to "a committee of twelve men" screening them for "national security impact". If deemed to have such impact, it would never be sent elsewhere. Otherwise, they would be sent to USAF or Naval offices handling ordinary UFO cases.\r\n\r\n    * Although he never used the name "MJ 12", Air Force Brig. Gen. Arthur E. Exon (Commanding Officer of Wright Patterson Air Force Base from 1964-1966) reported that a secret group of mostly high-ranking Pentagon officers were somehow involved with UFO studies; he nicknamed this group the "Unholy Thirteen". However, this does not necessarily mean Exon''s "Unholy 13" and "MJ 12" were the same group. When Stanton Friedman sent Exon a copy of his 1990 "Final Report on Operation Majestic 12," he reported Exon "strongly approved" the contents and that the names of the "Unholy 13" group "were those of high-level personnel he thought would know about what was happening, not of people he knew to be involved in a control group."\r\n\r\n    * Author Whitley Strieber in his books Breakthrough (1995) and Confirmation (1998) claimed his uncle Colonel Edward Strieber, who had spent much of his career at Wright-Patterson AFB, knew of MJ-12: "My uncle informed me that he had knowledge of the Majestic project. He spoke of the delivery of alien materials, artifacts, and biological remains to Wright Field from the Roswell Army Air Base in the summer of 1947. He felt sure that the existence of these materials and what to do about them had been debated at the highest levels of the government. ...In 1991, after I had written Majestic [a partly fictionalized account of the Roswell incident], my uncle put me into contact with a general [Arthur Exon] ? an old and trusted friend of his..." Strieber said Exon told him that everybody "from Truman on down" had known about the Roswell incident from the day it happened, and that it was known to be an alien spacecraft "almost as soon as we got on the scene."\r\n\r\n    * Edward J. Ruppelt, the director of the Air Force''s public UFO investigation Project Blue Book, several times in his 1956 book The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects hinted that there was another highly secretive UFO government group (or groups) operating parallel UFO investigations outside the public eye. For example, in discussing the demoralization of Project Sign personnel following the rejection by Gen. Hoyt Vandenberg of their 1948 Estimate of the Situation that UFOs were extraterrestrial, Ruppelt wrote that Sign personnel hardly investigated UFO sightings anymore and instead "More and more work was being pushed off onto the other investigative organization that was helping ATIC [Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson AFB]." Regarding the 1950 investigation of the so-called Lubbock Lights, Ruppelt wrote, ?The only other people outside Project Blue Book who have studied the complete case of the Lubbock Lights were a group who, due to their associations with the government, had complete access to our files. ...they were scientists?rocket experts, nuclear physicists, and intelligence experts. They had banded together to study our UFO reports because they were convinced that some of the UFO?s that were being reported were interplanetary spaceships...?\r\n\r\n    * UFO researcher and MJ-12 skeptic Brad Sparks, however, says evidence points to the group described by Ruppelt investigating the "Lubbock Lights" as being the CIA''s Office of Scientific Investigation (OS/I), not "MJ-12". However, Sparks has also found evidence that the CIA OS/I division (today called the Directorate of Science and Technology) became the primary investigative group for the DOD''s Research and Development Board (RDB) starting in January 1949. Researcher David Rudiak has pointed out that the 1950-51 Canadian documents mentioning an MJ-12-type group under Vannevar Bush''s direction has them operating precisely out of the RDB, which would again directly link "MJ-12" to the secret group investigating the Lubbock Lights, as described by Ruppelt. Furthermore, MJ-12 was supposed to be the control group, and it would be very much in Bush''s management style to assign investigative responsibility to others rather than MJ-12 conducting the detailed investigations themselves.\r\n\r\n    * UFO and paranormal researcher Ethan A. Blight has presented refutation of many of the arguments put forth by critics of the documents, especially those of UFO debunker Philip J. Klass, which are used in the "Arguments against" section below. Stanton Friedman has likewise presented arguments that many of Klass'' and other objections are either weak or completely bogus. Both Blight and Friedman argue that there exists no conclusive evidence against the authenticity of the documents, which, while not proving the documents'' authenticity, removes much doubt. Both also argue that such false or misleading arguments are in fact characteristic of UFO debunkers in general.\r\n\r\n    * The W-2 tax document provided by Bob Lazar in support of his claim to have worked briefly for classified UFO-related analysis projects at the Nevada Test Site included the interesting and otherwise unlikely OMB number of E-6722MAJ, implicitly for "Majestic".\r\n\r\nArguments against\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, the original MJ-12 documents are the 1947 Truman memo establishing MJ-12, the 1952 Eisenhower briefing document, and the 1954 Cutler/Twining memo from the National Archives.\r\n\r\nBelow are a number of arguments against the authenticity of various MJ-12 documents:\r\n\r\n    * The FBI investigated the matter, and quickly formed doubts as to the documents'' authenticity. FBI personnel contacted the U.S. Air Force, asking if MJ-12 had ever existed. The Air Force reported that no such committee had ever been authorized, and had never been formed. The FBI presently declares that "The investigation was closed after it was learned that the document was completely bogus."\r\n    * Critics note that the documents are of suspicious provenance. Shandera and Good both claimed to have received documents from anonymous senders, and most subsequent MJ-12 documents have surfaced under equally questionable circumstances.\r\n    * Though Good initially thought the documents were genuine, he has since, according to Philip Klass, expressed "suspicions about the new ... documents" due to "some factual anomalies in their content."\r\n    * UFO researcher Jerome Clark discusses the MJ-12 documents in the "Hoaxes" section of his The UFO Book, and strongly favors a hoax interpretation. He notes that as of 1998, a mere "handful" of ufologists support the documents'' authenticity.\r\n    * Another bit of evidence?which perhaps argues against Menzel''s membership, at least?is that in 1949, he reported a UFO encounter to the U.S. Air Force. It is argued Menzel would have no reason to send a "confidential" UFO report to the Air Force two years later when he witnessed two aerial lights he described as "exceptional." Furthermore, Menzel''s 1949 report makes no mention of any such group as MJ-12. See the main Donald Menzel page for more information and a counterargument.\r\n    * Scientific forensic linguistic testing was applied to select Majestic Documents in 2007 by Dr. Carol Chaski and found scientific forensic evidence to disprove attributed authorship. Dr. Chaski is the founder of The Institute for Linguistic Evidence (ILE), a research organization that validates reliable document authentication techniques and provides assistance to investigators and attorneys in criminal and civil trials whenever the authorship of any document is questioned or suspicious.."\r\n\r\n    * Nevertheless, the format by the Majestic-12 Documents, with justification and different fonts and type-sizes, generates right doubts: the first typewriter with IBM typeballs (selector compensator) and with it to replaceable fonts was IBM 72, built from 1962, and only the successors of this machine also had the memory necessary for justification.\r\n\r\nBriefing document and Truman letter\r\n\r\nMuch evidence has been found, leading skeptics to argue that the briefing document and Truman letter are fake.\r\n\r\n    * The typewriter used\r\n          o The typewriter used for the Truman letter was a Smith Corona model which did not exist until 1962 - fifteen years after the document was allegedly written.\r\n          o The typewriter ribbon was worn and the keys were dirty. Truman documents from the period that are known to be authentic used fresh ribbons and clean keys.\r\n\r\n    * The Truman signature\r\n          o The signature of Harry Truman on the alleged letter to Forrestal is identical to the one known to be authentic on a letter to Vannevar Bush on October 1, 1947. The one on the briefing document is 3 to 4 percent larger and bolder, but this is explained by the fact that photocopiers do not reproduce things at exactly the same size. They match when the size is corrected and one is laid over the other.\r\n          o Both signatures show a unique slip of the pen when starting the "H".\r\n          o The "T" in the October 1, 1947 signature intersected the final "s" in "Sincerely yours". The same point on the Forrestal letter is slightly thinner, as if the intersection with the "s" had been modified with liquid paper or the like before photocopying.\r\n          o Since two different signatures from one person will always differ, this shows that the authentic Truman signature from the letter to Bush was copied onto the bogus letter to Forrestal, which was then photocopied.\r\n\r\n    * Date format and name format in the briefing document\r\n          o The dates have a superfluous comma after the month, e.g. "18 November, 1952". A comma is not used after the month in this date format. Every date in the briefing document has this error.\r\n          o No known authentic letters or memos from Hillenkoetter has the error of the superfluous comma and none used the prepended zero.\r\n          o All known authentic Hillenkoetter letters and memos use "R. H. Hillenkoetter" as the author''s name, whereas the briefing document uses "Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter".\r\n\r\n    * Other issues\r\n          o The "TOP SECRET/MAJIC EYES ONLY" stamped on the document used a rubber stamp with movable letters, unlike actual classification stamps. The "I" was raised slightly.\r\n          o Authentic Top Secret documents have a page count and page numbering: "Page __ of __ pages". The briefing document does not have this.\r\n          o The warnings against copying do not match the wording of actual documents from the period of 1952.\r\n          o The document uses "media" instead of "press", "extra-terrestrial" instead of "alien", and uses "impacted" as a verb?these words were not in common use until the 1960s.\r\n          o James Mosley, who personally knew alleged MJ-12 member Menzel found evidence that Menzel and alleged co-member Hillenkoetter did not know each other.\r\n\r\n    * Record searches. Other than the questioned Cutler memo, no other document mentioning MJ-12 has been found (not even the original briefing document).\r\n          o The National Archives found no record of an NSC meeting on July 16, 1954. A search of all NSC meetings for July 1954 did not find any mention of MJ-12 or Majestic.\r\n          o A branch of the National Archives searched NSC records for any listing of MJ-12 or Majestic and found none.\r\n\r\nThe Cutler Memo\r\n\r\n    * The NARA has issued a detailed list of problems which calls the Cutler memo''s authenticity into question.\r\n\r\n   1. The document was located in Record Group 341, entry 267. The series is filed by a Top Secret register number. This document does not bear such a number.[19]\r\n   2. The document is filed in the folder T4-1846. There are no other documents in the folder regarding "NSC/MJ-12."\r\n   3. Researchers on the staff of the National Archives have searched in the records of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Headquarters U.S. Air Force, and in other related files. No further information has been found on this subject.\r\n   4. Inquiries to the U.S. Air Force, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the National Security Council failed to produce further information.\r\n   5. The Freedom of Information Office of the National Security Council informed the National Archives that "Top Secret Restricted Information" is a marking which did not come into use at the National Security Council until the Nixon Administration. The Eisenhower Presidential Library also confirms that this particular marking was not used during the Eisenhower Administration.\r\n   6. The document in question does not bear an official government letterhead or watermark. The NARA conservation specialist examined the paper and determined it was a ribbon copy (i.e. not a carbon copy) prepared on "dictation onionskin." The Eisenhower Library has examined a representative sample of the documents in its collection of the Cutler papers. All documents in the sample created by Mr. Cutler while he served on the NSC staff have an eagle watermark in the bond paper. The onionskin carbon copies have either an eagle watermark or no watermark at all. Most documents sent out by the NSC were prepared on White House letterhead paper. For the brief period when Cutler left the NSC, his carbon copies were prepared on "prestige onionskin."\r\n   7. The National Archives searched the Official Meeting Minute Files of the National Security Council and found no record of an NSC meeting on July 16, 1954. A search of all NSC Meeting Minutes for July 1954 found no mention of MJ-12 nor Majestic.\r\n   8. The Judicial, Fiscal and Social Branch searched the indices of the NSC records and found no listing for: MJ-12, Majestic, unidentified flying objects, UFO, flying saucers, or flying discs.\r\n   9. NAJA found a memo in a folder titled "Special Meeting July 16, 1956" which indicated that NSC members would be called to a civil defense exercise on July 16, 1956.\r\n  10. The Eisenhower Library states, in a letter to the Military Reference Branch, dated July 16, 1987:\r\n\r\n        "president Eisenhower''s Appointment Books contain no entry for a special meeting on July 16, 1954 which might have included a briefing on MJ-12. Even when the President had ''off the record'' meetings, the Appointment Books contain entries indicating the time of the meeting and the participants ...\r\n\r\n        "The Declassification office of the National Security Council has informed us that it has no record of any declassification action having been taken on this memorandum or any other documents on this alleged project ..."\r\n\r\n        Robert Cutler, at the direction of President Eisenhower, was visiting overseas military installations on the day he supposedly issued this memorandum &#8722; July 14, 1954. The Administration Series in Eisenhower''s Papers as President contains Cutler''s memorandum and report to the President upon his return from the trip. The memorandum is dated July 20, 1954 and refers to Cutler''s visits to installations in Europe and North Africa between July 3 and 15. Also, within the NSC Staff Papers is a memorandum dated July 3, 1954, from Cutler to his two subordinates, James S. Lay and J. Patrick Cone, explaining how they should handle NSC administrative matters during his absence; one would assume that if the memorandum to Twining were genuine, Lay or Cone would have signed it."\r\n\r\nIn addition, although the Cutler memo was supposedly a carbon copy, it was folded as if it had been in a shirt pocket, which would be unusual for a carbon copy put in a file. The memo is in the National Archives; the question is how it got there, and if it is authentic.\r\n\r\nA document entitled "SOM1-01: Extraterrestrial Entities and Technology, Recovery and Disposal" (ref. http://209.132.68.98/pdf/som101_part1.pdf) and found on www.majesticdocuments.com contains paragraphs with subheads set in the sans serif "Helvetica" typeface. The document purports to be from 1954 yet the typeface in question was first designed in 1957 by the Swiss graphic designer, Max Miedinger. The capitalized sans serif letter "R" (and others) found on many pages confirms that this typeface is not the much earlier Akzidenz Grotesk sans serif typeface. This evidence seems to strongly suggest that this document is a fabrication.\r\n\r\nMJ-12 in later allegations\r\n	This section does not cite any references or sources.\r\nPlease help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unverifiable material may be challenged and removed. (August 2007)\r\n\r\nSoon after their disclosure, MJ-12 was absorbed into many other alleged conspiracies; Milton William Cooper''s works (especially Behold A Pale Horse) are key in this introducing MJ-12 to a wider, conspiratorially-minded audience, and have generated significant criticism as unfounded. Some of these later versions insist that the "M" in "MJ-12" stands not for "Majestic" but for "Majority".\r\n\r\nIn the Unofficial X-Files Companion: Volume 2 author N.E. Genge remarks that according to less extravagant conspiracy theory lore, Majestic 12 was created with a more humble goal: to cover up alien activities on Earth, and liaise with the aliens to obtain technology in exchange for knowledge and testing on human biology.\r\n\r\nMJ-12 plays a crucial role in the PC game Deus Ex, where it is revealed that the organization controls the United Nations and many world governments.\r\n\r\nPresent-day MJ-12\r\n\r\nDespite strong evidence that many MJ-12 documents are hoaxed, much evidence suggests that an MJ-12-type group did exist and efforts continue to the present.[citation needed] For example, UFO researcher Bill Hamilton says he has identified the present-day members of MJ-12.[citation needed] Gordon Novel, a shadowy figure associated with various CIA conspiracies, Watergate, and the Jim Garrison investigation of the Kennedy assassination, in a recent interview, further adds that most are Americans with a few foreigners.[citation needed] Allegedly they[who?] were involved with Kennedy''s murder because Kennedy wanted to end the cover-up.[citation needed] They are major world power brokers and manipulate events behind the scenes in a bid for total world power.[citation needed] Supposedly a key motivation behind the cover-up is reverse-engineering captured alien technology in order to obtain such domination.[citation needed] Moreover, many criminal acts have been committed towards this end, including numerous murders to maintain security and control of international drug trafficking to pay for the huge research and security costs. Novel background and interview\r\n\r\nAnother person to say that MJ-12 still existed was Dr. Eric Walker (see Arguments for above).[citation needed] When originally contacted, Walker said he had known of their existence since their creation in 1947.[citation needed] Similar to Novel, Walker in a later 1990 interview said the current membership was mostly American but had added some foreigners.[citation needed] They were a highly elite group of individuals and Walker repeatedly discouraged interviewers from trying to learn more, saying there was nothing the average person could do.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n   1. ^ Bishop, Greg (2005).

INSERT INTO `wiki` VALUES (44, 'Roswell UFO Incident', 'The Roswell UFO Incident involved the recovery of materials near Roswell, New Mexico, USA, on July 7, 1947, and since the early 1980s has become the subject of intense speculation, rumor and questioning. There are widely divergent views on what actually happened and passionate debate about what evidence can be believed. The United States military maintains that what was actually recovered was debris from an experimental high-altitude surveillance balloon belonging to a classified program named "Mogul". Many UFO proponents maintain that a crashed alien craft and bodies were recovered, and that the military engaged in a cover-up. The incident has turned into a widely known pop culture phenomenon, and for some, Roswell is synonymous with UFOs. It ranks as one of the most publicized and controversial UFO incidents ever.\r\nContents\r\n[hide]\r\n\r\n    * 1 Background\r\n    * 2 Contemporary accounts of materials found\r\n          o 2.1 News reports\r\n    * 3 Alien accounts emerge\r\n          o 3.1 New witness accounts and Roswell UFO books\r\n          o 3.2 The Roswell Incident (1980)\r\n          o 3.3 UFO Crash at Roswell (1991)\r\n          o 3.4 Crash at Corona (1992)\r\n          o 3.5 The Truth about the UFO Crash at Roswell (1994)\r\n          o 3.6 UFO community schism\r\n    * 4 Air Force and skeptics respond to alien reports\r\n          o 4.1 Air Force reports on the Roswell UFO incident\r\n          o 4.2 Problems with witness accounts\r\n          o 4.3 Contradictory conclusions, questionable research, Roswell as a myth\r\n    * 5 Recent developments\r\n          o 5.1 Pro-UFO advocates dismiss Roswell incident\r\n          o 5.2 Shoddy research revealed; witnesses suspected of hoaxes\r\n          o 5.3 Photo analysis; documentaries; new claims\r\n          o 5.4 Project Serpo\r\n          o 5.5 Top Secret/Majic (2005, with new afterword)\r\n          o 5.6 Witness to Roswell (2007)\r\n          o 5.7 Walter Haut controversy\r\n    * 6 Cultural influence\r\n          o 6.1 Film\r\n          o 6.2 Celebrations\r\n          o 6.3 Literature\r\n          o 6.4 Television\r\n          o 6.5 Comics, series and animation\r\n          o 6.6 Music\r\n          o 6.7 Video Games\r\n    * 7 See also\r\n    * 8 References\r\n\r\n\r\n[edit] Background\r\nRoswell UFO Incident is located in New Mexico\r\nRoswell UFO Incident\r\nLocation of Roswell, New Mexico\r\n\r\nOn July 8, 1947, the Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF) issued a press release stating that personnel from the field''s 509th Bomb Group had recovered a crashed "flying disc" from a ranch near Roswell, sparking intense media interest. Later the same day, the Commanding General of the Eighth Air Force stated that, in fact, a weather balloon had been recovered by RAAF personnel, rather than a "flying saucer."[1] A subsequent press conference was called, featuring debris said to be from the crashed object that seemed to confirm the weather balloon description. The case was quickly forgotten and almost completely ignored, even by UFO researchers, for more than 30 years. Then, in 1978, ufologist Stanton T. Friedman interviewed Major Jesse Marcel, who was involved with the original recovery of the debris in 1947. Marcel expressed his belief that the military had covered up the recovery of an alien spacecraft. His story circulated through UFO circles, being featured in some UFO documentaries at the time.[2] In February 1980, The National Enquirer ran its own interview with Marcel, garnering national and worldwide attention for the Roswell incident.\r\n\r\nAdditional witnesses and reports emerged over the following years. They added significant new details, including claims of a large military operation dedicated to recovering alien craft and aliens themselves, at as many as 11 crash sites,[2] and alleged witness intimidation. In 1989, former mortician Glenn Dennis put forth a detailed personal account, wherein he claimed that alien autopsies were carried out at the Roswell base.[3]\r\n\r\nIn response to these reports, and after congressional inquiries, the General Accounting Office launched an inquiry and directed the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force to conduct an internal investigation. The result was summarized in two reports. The first, released in 1995, concluded that the reported recovered material in 1947 was likely debris from a secret government program called Project Mogul, which involved high altitude balloons meant to detect sound waves generated by Soviet atomic bomb tests and ballistic missiles.[4] The second report, released in 1997, concluded that reports of recovered alien bodies were likely a combination of: innocently transformed memories of military accidents involving injured or killed personnel; innocently transformed memories of the recovery of anthropomorphic dummies in military programs like Project High Dive conducted in the 1950s; hoaxes perpetrated by various witnesses and UFO proponents. The psychological effects of time compression and confusion about when events occurred explained the discrepancy with the years in question. These reports were dismissed by UFO proponents as being either disinformation or simply implausible, though significant numbers of UFO researchers discount the probability that any alien crash was in fact involved.[5][6][7]\r\n\r\n[edit] Contemporary accounts of materials found\r\nThe Sacramento Bee article detailing the RAAF statements.\r\n\r\nOn June 14, 1947 William "Mac" Brazel noticed some strange clusters of debris while working on the Foster homestead, where he was foreman, some 30 miles north of Roswell. This exact date (or "about three weeks" before July 8) is a point of contention[8] but is repeated in several initial accounts, in particular the stories that quote Brazel and in a telex sent a few hours after the story broke quoting Sheriff George Wilcox (who Brazel first contacted). However, the initial press release from the Roswell Army Air Field said the find was "sometime last week," suggesting Brazel found the debris in early July.[9] Brazel told the Roswell Daily Record that he and his son saw a "large area of bright wreckage made up of rubber strips, tinfoil, a rather tough paper and sticks." He paid little attention to it but returned on July 4 with his son, wife and daughter to gather up the material.[10] Some accounts have described Brazel as having gathered some of the material earlier, rolling it together and stashing it under some brush.[11] The next day, Brazel heard reports about "flying discs" and wondered if that was what he had picked up. On July 7, Brazel saw Sheriff Wilcox and "whispered kinda confidential like" that he may have found a flying disc.[10] Another account quotes Wilcox as saying that Brazel reported the object on July 6.[9]\r\n\r\nSheriff Wilcox called Roswell Army Air Field. Major Jesse Marcel and a "man in plainclothes" accompanied Brazel back to the ranch where more pieces were picked up. "[We] spent a couple of hours Monday afternoon [July 7] looking for any more parts of the weather device", said Marcel. "We found a few more patches of tinfoil and rubber."[12] They then attempted to reassemble the object, but Brazel said they could not. Marcel took the debris to Roswell Army Air Field the next morning.\r\n\r\nAs described in the July 9, 1947, edition of the Roswell Daily Record,[13]\r\n? 	"The balloon which held it up, if that was how it worked, must have been 12 feet long, [Brazel] felt, measuring the distance by the size of the room in which he sat. The rubber was smoky gray in color and scattered over an area about 200 yards in diameter. When the debris was gathered up, the tinfoil, paper, tape, and sticks made a bundle about three feet long and 7 or 8 inches thick, while the rubber made a bundle about 18 or 20 inches long and about 8 inches thick. In all, he estimated, the entire lot would have weighed maybe five pounds. There was no sign of any metal in the area which might have been used for an engine, and no sign of any propellers of any kind, although at least one paper fin had been glued onto some of the tinfoil. There were no words to be found anywhere on the instrument, although there were letters on some of the parts. Considerable Scotch tape and some tape with flowers printed upon it had been used in the construction. No strings or wires were to be found but there were some eyelets in the paper to indicate that some sort of attachment may have been used.? 	?\r\n\r\nA telex sent to an FBI office from their office in Dallas, Texas, quoted a major from the Eighth Air Force on July 8:[14]\r\n? 	"THE DISC IS HEXAGONAL IN SHAPE AND WAS SUSPENDED FROM A BALLON [sic] BY CABLE, WHICH BALLON [sic] WAS APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FEET IN DIAMETER. MAJOR CURTAN FURTHER ADVISED THAT THE OBJECT FOUND RESEMBLES A HIGH ALTITUDE WEATHER BALLOON WITH A RADAR REFLECTOR, BUT THAT TELEPHONIC CONVERSATION BETWEEN THEIR OFFICE AND WRIGHT FIELD HAD NOT [unintelligible] BORNE OUT THIS BELIEF." 	?\r\n\r\n[edit] News reports\r\nA NOAA weather balloon just after launch.\r\n\r\nEarly on Tuesday, July 8, the Roswell Army Air Field issued a press release which was immediately picked up by numerous news outlets:[15]\r\n? 	"The many rumors regarding the flying disc became a reality yesterday when the intelligence office of the 509th Bomb group of the Eighth Air Force, Roswell Army Air Field, was fortunate enough to gain possession of a disc through the cooperation of one of the local ranchers and the sheriff''s office of Chaves County. The flying object landed on a ranch near Roswell sometime last week. Not having phone facilities, the rancher stored the disc until such time as he was able to contact the sheriff''s office, who in turn notified Maj. Jesse A. Marcel of the 509th Bomb Group Intelligence Office. Action was immediately taken and the disc was picked up at the rancher''s home. It was inspected at the Roswell Army Air Field and subsequently loaned by Major Marcel to higher headquarters." 	?\r\n\r\nColonel William H. Blanchard, commanding officer of the 509th, contacted General Roger M. Ramey of the Eighth Air Force in Fort Worth, Texas, and Ramey ordered the object be flown to Fort Worth Army Air Field. At the base, Warrant Officer Irving Newton confirmed Ramey?s preliminary opinion, identifying the object as being a weather balloon and its "kite,"[11] a nickname for a radar reflector used to track the balloons from the ground. Another news release was issued, this time from the Fort Worth base, describing the object as being a "weather balloon."\r\n\r\nIn Fort Worth, several news photographs were taken that day of debris said to be from the object. The debris was consistent with the general description of a weather balloon with a kite. Ramey, Col. Thomas J. Dubose and Marcel all posed with the debris. Brazel, in interviews that day with the Roswell Daily Record and Associated Press, dismissed the military''s "weather balloon" assertion. Citing several other weather balloons he had recovered previously on the ranch, he said: "I am sure what I found was not any weather balloon."[13]\r\n\r\n[edit] Alien accounts emerge\r\n\r\n[edit] New witness accounts and Roswell UFO books\r\n\r\nIn 1978, former nuclear physicist and author Stanton T. Friedman interviewed Jesse Marcel, the only person known to have accompanied the Roswell debris from where it was recovered to Fort Worth. Over the next few years, the accounts he and others gave elevated Roswell from a forgotten incident to perhaps the most famous UFO case of all time.[2]\r\n\r\nBy the early 1990s, UFO researchers such as Friedman, William Moore, Karl T. Pflock, and the team of Kevin D. Randle and Donald R. Schmitt had interviewed several hundred people who had, or claimed to have had, a connection with the events at Roswell in 1947.[16] Additionally, hundreds of documents were obtained via Freedom of Information Act requests, as were some apparently leaked by insiders, such as the disputed "Majestic 12" documents.[17]\r\n\r\nTheir conclusions were that at least one alien craft had crashed in the Roswell vicinity, that aliens, some possibly still alive, were recovered, and that a massive cover-up of any knowledge of the incident was put in place.\r\n\r\n    See also: Witness accounts of the Roswell UFO incident\r\n\r\nNumerous books, articles, television specials and even a made-for-TV movie brought the 1947 incident fame and notoriety so that by the mid-1990s, strong majorities in polls, such as a 1997 CNN/Time poll, believed that aliens had visited earth and specifically that aliens had landed at Roswell and the government was covering up the fact.[18]\r\n\r\nA new narrative emerged which was at strong odds with what was reported in 1947. This narrative evolved over the years from the time the first book on Roswell was published in 1980 as many new witnesses and accounts emerged, drawn out in part by publicity on the incident. Though skeptics had many objections to the plausibility of these accounts, it was not until 1994 and the publication of the first Air Force report on the incident that a strong counter-argument to the presence of aliens was widely publicized.\r\n\r\nNumerous scenarios emerged from these authors as to what they felt were the true sequence of events, depending on which witness accounts were embraced or dismissed, and what the documentary evidence suggested. This was especially true in regards to the various claimed crash and recovery sites of alien craft, as various authors had different witnesses and different locations for these events.[2]\r\n\r\nHowever, the following general outline from UFO Crash at Roswell (1991) by Kevin D. Randle and Donald R. Schmitt is common to most of these accounts:\r\n? 	A UFO crashed northwest of Roswell, Newmexico, in the summer of 1947. The military acted quickly and efficiently to recover the debris after its existence was reported by a ranch hand. The debris - unlike anything these highly trained men had ever seen - was flown without delay to at least three government installations. A cover story was concocted to explain away the debris and the flurry of activity. It was explained that a weather balloon, one with a new radiosonde target device, had been found and temporarily confused the personnel of the 509th Bomb Group. Government officials took reporters'' notes from their desks and warned a radio reporter not to play a recorded interview with the ranch hand. The men who took part in the recovery were told never to talk about the incident. And with a whimper, not a bang, the Roswell event faded quickly from public view and press scrutiny.[19] 	?\r\n\r\nWhat follows are accounts of the sequence of events according to some of the major books published on the subject.\r\n\r\n[edit] The Roswell Incident (1980)\r\n\r\nThe first book on the subject, The Roswell Incident[20] by Charles Berlitz and William L. Moore, was published in 1980. The authors at the time said they had interviewed more than ninety witnesses. Though uncredited, Stanton Friedman did substantial research for the book.[21] The book featured accounts of debris described by Jesse Marcel as ?nothing made on this earth.?[20] (p.28) Additional accounts suggested that the material Marcel recovered had super-strength and other attributes not associated with anything known of terrestrial origin, and certainly not anything associated with a ?weather balloon.? The book also introduced the contention that debris recovered by Marcel at the Foster ranch was substituted for debris from a weather device[20] (p.33; pp. 67-69) as part of a cover-up. Marcel posed with the actual debris, then the material was switched and others posed with the switched debris. The actual debris recovered from the ranch ? which, the authors claimed, was from a crashed UFO ? was not permitted a close inspection by the press. Also described were efforts by the military to discredit and ?counteract the growing hysteria towards flying saucers.?[20] (p.42) Additionally, various accounts of witness intimidation were included, in particular reports of the incarceration of Mac Brazel, who reported the debris in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe book also introduced an alien account by Barney Barnett who had died years earlier. Friends said he had on numerous occasions described the crash of a flying saucer and the recovery of alien corpses in the Socorro area, about 150 miles (240 km) west of the Foster ranch. He and a group of archaeologists who happened to be in the vicinity had stumbled upon an alien craft and its occupants, only to be led away by military personnel.[20] (pp.53-62) Further accounts suggested that these aliens and their craft were shipped to Edwards Air Force Base (known then as Muroc Army Air Field) in California.[20] (Ch.5) The book suggested that either there were two crafts which crashed or debris from the vehicle Barnett had described had landed on the Foster ranch after an explosion.[20] (p.62)\r\n\r\nWhen, exactly, Marcel and "Cavitt" (Sheridan Cavitt, Marcel could not recall his first name) went to see the debris is not clear as he says "We heard about it on July 7" on page 63,[20] but seems to say that he was contacted the day before when he said "[on] Sunday, July 6, Brazel decided he had better go into town and report this to someone," who in turn called Marcel.[20] (p.65) In 1947, Marcel was quoted as saying he visited the ranch on Monday, July 7.\r\n\r\nMarcel described returning to Roswell the evening of July 7 to find that news of the discovery of a flying disc had leaked out. Calls were made to his house, including a visit from a reporter, but he could not confirm this. "The next morning, that written press release went out, and after that things really hit the fan."[20] (p.67)\r\n\r\nThe book suggested that the military orchestrated Brazel''s testimony to make it appear a mundane object had landed on the ranch, though the book did not explicitly say that the military instructed Brazel to give a mid-June date for his discovery. (The mid-June date is not mentioned in the book.) "Brazel... [went] to great pains to tell the newspaper people exactly what the Air Force had instructed him to say regarding how he had come to discover the wreckage and what it looked like..."[20] (p.40)\r\n\r\n[edit] UFO Crash at Roswell (1991)\r\n\r\nIn 1991, with the benefit of a decade of publicity on the incident and numerous new witness interviews, Kevin D. Randle and Donald R. Schmitt published UFO Crash at Roswell.[22] Here, new witnesses generally added more detail that tended to corroborate the account found in The Roswell Incident, such as more accounts of the unearthly qualities of the recovered debris, interviews with Col. Thomas Dubose suggesting a switch of material and cover-up had occurred, and new accounts of intimidation of witnesses like Mac Brazel. Marcel, in this book, had never posed with the actual debris, it was switched before the press saw any of it.\r\n\r\nTimelines were slightly altered. The date that Brazel reported the debris and Marcel went to the ranch was said to be Sunday, July 6, not the next day as some of the original accounts suggested, and The Roswell Incident had left unclear. Additionally, Marcel and an unidentified counter-intelligence agent spent the night at the ranch, something not mentioned previously. They gathered material on Monday, then Marcel dropped by his house on the way to the Roswell base in the early hours of Tuesday, July 8.\r\n\r\nSignificant new details emerged, including accounts of a "gouge... that extended four or five hundred feet" at the ranch[22] (p.200) and descriptions of an elaborate cordon and recovery operation. (Several witnesses in The Roswell Incident described being turned back from the Foster ranch by armed military police, but more extensive descriptions were lacking.)\r\n\r\nThe Barnett accounts were mentioned, though the dates and locations were changed from the accounts found in The Roswell Incident. In this new account, Brazel is described as leading the Army to a second crash site on the ranch, where the Army was "horrified to find civilians [including Barnett] there already."[22] (p.206)\r\n\r\nNew witness accounts added substantially to the reports of aliens and their recovery. Glenn Dennis had emerged as an important witness after calling the hotline when an episode of ?Unsolved Mysteries? featured the Roswell incident in 1989. His descriptions of Roswell alien autopsies were the first to place alien corpses at the Roswell Army Air Base.[2]\r\n\r\nNo mention, except in passing, was made of the claim found in The Roswell Incident that the Roswell aliens and their craft were shipped to Edwards Air Force Base. The book established a chain of events with alien corpses seen at a crash site, their bodies shipped to the Roswell base as witnessed by Dennis, and then flown to Fort Worth and finally to Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio, the last known location of the bodies (accounts assembled in part from the testimony of Frank Kaufmann and Capt. O. W. ?Pappy? Henderson).\r\n\r\nThe book also introduced an account from General Arthur E. Exon, an officer stationed at the alleged final resting place of the recovered material. He claimed there was a shadowy group which he called the Unholy Thirteen who controlled and had access to whatever was recovered.[22] (pp.231-234) He later said:[23]\r\n? 	"In the ''55 time period [when Exon was at the Pentagon], there was also the story that whatever happened, whatever was found at Roswell was still closely held and probably would be held until these fellows I mentioned had died so they wouldn''t be embarrassed or they wouldn''t have to explain why they covered it up. ...until the original thirteen died off and I don''t think anyone is going to release anything [until] the last one''s gone." 	?\r\n\r\n[edit] Crash at Corona (1992)\r\n\r\nStanton Friedman?s 1992 book, Crash at Corona,[24] (written with Don Berliner) suggested a high-level cover-up of a UFO recovery, based on documents he obtained such as the Majestic 12 archive. These documents were anonymously dropped off at a UFO researcher?s house in 1984 and purported to be 1952 briefing papers for incoming President Dwight Eisenhower describing a high-level government agency whose purpose was to investigate aliens recovered at Roswell and to keep such information hidden from public view. Friedman had done much of the research for The Roswell Incident with William Moore, and Crash at Corona built on that research. Corona is in the title instead of Roswell because it is geographically closer to the Foster ranch crash site.[24](p.ix)\r\n\r\nThe time-line is largely the same as previously, with Marcel and Cavitt visiting the ranch on Sunday, July 6. But the book says that Brazel was "taken into custody for about a week" and escorted into the offices of the Roswell Daily Record on July 10 where he gave an account he was told to give by the government.[24] (pp.79-80)\r\n\r\nA sign of the disputes between various researchers is on display as Friedman and Berliner move the Barnett account back to near Socorro and introduce a new eyewitness account of the site from Gerald Anderson who provided vivid descriptions of both a downed alien craft and four aliens, of which at least one was alive.[24](pp.90-97) The authors note that UFO Crash at Roswell "without a solid basis" dismisses much of the evidence Crash at Corona is based upon,[24] (p.206) and that "a personality conflict between Anderson and Randle" meant that Friedman was the author who investigated his claim.[24] (p.89) The book, however, largely embraces the sequence of events from UFO Crash at Roswell where aliens are seen at the Roswell Army Air Field, based on the Dennis account, and then shipped off to Fort Worth and then Wright Field.\r\n\r\nThe book suggests as many as eight alien corpses were recovered from two crash sites: three dead and perhaps one alive from the Foster ranch, and three dead and one living from the Socorro site.[24] (p.129)\r\n\r\n[edit] The Truth about the UFO Crash at Roswell (1994)\r\n\r\nIn 1994, Randle and Schmitt published a second book, The Truth about the UFO Crash at Roswell.[25] While restating much of the case as laid out in their earlier book UFO Crash at Roswell, new and expanded accounts of aliens were included, and a new location for the recovery of aliens was detailed. Additionally, an almost completely new scenario as to the sequence of events was laid out.\r\n\r\nFor the first time, the object was said to have crashed on the evening of Friday, July 4 instead of Wednesday July 2, the date in all the previous books. Another important difference was the assertion that the alien recovery was well under way before Brazel went into Roswell with his news about debris on the Foster ranch. Indeed, several objects had been tracked by radar for a few days in the vicinity before one crashed. In all previous accounts, the military was made aware of the alleged alien crash only when Brazel came forward. Additionally, Brazel was said to have given his news conference on July 9, and his press conference and the initial news release announcing the discovery of a "flying disc" were all part of an elaborate ruse to shift attention away from the "true" crash site.\r\n\r\nThe book featured a new witness account describing an alien craft and aliens from Jim Ragsdale, at a new location just north of Roswell, instead of closer to Corona on the Foster ranch. Corroboration was given by accounts from a group of archaeologists. Five alien corpses were seen.[25](pp.3-11) While the Foster ranch was a source of debris as well, no bodies were recovered there.\r\n\r\nExpanded accounts came from Dennis and Kaufmann. And a new account from Ruben Anaya described New Mexico Lieutenant Governor Joseph Montoya''s claim that he saw alien corpses at the Roswell base.\r\n\r\nMore disagreement between Roswell researchers is on display in the book. A full chapter is devoted to dismissing the Barnett and Anderson accounts from Socorro, a central part of Crash at Corona and The Roswell Incident. "...Barnett''s story, and in fact, the Plains of [San Augustin, near Soccoro] scenario, must be discarded," say the authors.[25] (p.155) An appendix is devoted to describing the Majestic 12 documents, another central part of Crash at Corona, as a "hoax."[25] (p.187)\r\n\r\nThe two Randle and Schmitt books remain highly influential in the UFO community, their interviews and conclusions widely reproduced on websites.[26] Randle and Schmitt claimed to have "conducted more than two thousand interviews with more than five hundred people" during their Roswell investigations.[27]\r\n\r\n[edit] UFO community schism\r\n\r\nBy the publication of The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell in 1994, a serious split had emerged within the UFO community as to the true sequence of the events and the locations of the alleged alien crash sites.[28](p.24) CUFOS (Center for UFO Studies) and MUFON (Mutual UFO Network), two leading UFO societies, were at odds over the various scenarios presented by Randle/Schmitt and Friedman/Berliner, so much so that several conferences were held to try to resolve the differences. One of the issues under discussion was where, precisely, Barnett was when he saw the alien craft he was said to have encountered. A 1992 conference tried to achieve a consensus among the various scenarios as portrayed in Crash at Corona and UFO Crash at Roswell, but the publication of The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell in 1994 "resolved" the Barnett problem by simply ignoring him and citing a new location for the alien craft recovery, including a new group of archaeologists not connected to the ones the Barnett story cited.[28](p.25)\r\n\r\nThis fundamental disagreement over the location of the alleged crash sites still exists within the UFO community today.\r\n\r\n[edit] Air Force and skeptics respond to alien reports\r\n\r\n[edit] Air Force reports on the Roswell UFO incident\r\n\r\n    Main article: Air Force reports on the Roswell UFO incident\r\n\r\nIn the mid-1990s, the United States Air Force issued two reports which, they said, accounted for the debris found and reported on in 1947, and which also accounted for the later reports of alien recoveries. The reports identified the debris as coming from a top secret government experiment called Project Mogul, which tested the feasibility of detecting Soviet nuclear tests and ballistic missiles with equipment on high-altitude balloons. Accounts of aliens were explained as resulting from misidentified military experiments which used anthropomorphic dummies and accidents involving injured or killed military personnel.\r\n\r\nThe Air Force report formed a basis for a skeptical response to the claims many authors were making about the recovery of aliens, though skeptical researchers such as Philip J. Klass and Robert Todd had already been publishing articles for several years raising doubts about alien accounts before the Air Force issued its conclusions.\r\n\r\nWhile books published into the 1990s suggested there was much more to the Roswell incident than the mere recovery of a weather balloon, skeptics, and even some social anthropologists,[28] instead saw the increasingly elaborate accounts as evidence of a myth being constructed. After the release of the Air Force reports in the mid-1990s, several books, such as Kal K. Korff''s The Roswell UFO Crash: What They Don''t Want You To Know published in 1997, built on the evidence presented in the reports to conclude "there is no credible evidence that the remains of an extraterrestrial spacecraft was involved."[16]\r\n\r\nCritics identified several reasons for their contention that the Roswell incident had nothing to do with aliens:\r\n\r\n[edit] Problems with witness accounts\r\n\r\n    Main article: Witness accounts of the Roswell UFO incident\r\n\r\nHundreds of witnesses were interviewed by the various researchers, a seemingly impressive figure, but a comparable few were true "witnesses" who claimed to have actually seen debris or aliens, critics point out. Most "witnesses" were in fact repeating the claims of others, and their testimony would be inadmissible hearsay in an American court, says Korff.[21] (p.29) Of the 90 witnesses claimed to have been interviewed for The Roswell Incident, says Korff, the testimony of only 25 appear in the book, and only seven actually saw the debris. Of these, five handled the debris. (ibid)\r\n\r\nThe late Karl T. Pflock, in his 2001 book Roswell: Inconvenient Facts and the Will to Believe, makes a similar point about Randle and Schmitt''s UFO Crash at Roswell. Some 271 people are listed in the book who were "contacted and interviewed" for the book, and this number does not include those who chose to remain anonymous, etc., meaning more than 300 "witnesses" were interviewed, a figure Pflock said the authors frequently cited.[29] (p.176) Of these 300-plus individuals, said Pflock, only 41 can be "considered genuine first- or second-hand witnesses to the events in and around Roswell or at the Fort Worth Army Air Field," and only 23 can be "reasonably thought to have seen physical evidence, debris recovered from the Foster Ranch." Of these, said Pflock, only seven have asserted anything suggestive of otherworldly origins for the debris.[29] (p.177)\r\n\r\nAs for the several accounts from those who claimed to have seen aliens, critics identified problems with these accounts ranging from the reliability of second-hand accounts (Pappy Henderson, General Exon, etc.), to serious credibility problems with witnesses making demonstrably false claims or multiple, contradictory accounts (Gerald Anderson, Glenn Dennis, Frank Kaufmann, Jim Ragsdale), to dubious death-bed "confessions" or accounts from elderly and easily confused witnesses (Maj. Edwin Easley, Lewis Rickett).[21] (ch.3)\r\n\r\nPflock, writing in 2001, noted that only four people with firsthand knowledge of alien bodies were interviewed and identified by Roswell authors: Frank Kaufmann; Jim Ragsdale; Lt. Col. Albert Lovejoy Duran; Gerald Anderson.[29] (p.118) Duran is mentioned in a brief footnote in The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell and never again, while the other three all have serious credibility problems, said Pflock.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Pflock points out that certain authors embrace accounts which do not fit within the scenarios they support. The accounts of Frankie Rowe, for example, say her firefighter father and his crew were called out to an alien crash site. But the same book embraces other accounts which describe a highly secret military-led operation. "[The accounts] seem to be included as part of a throw everything at the wall and see what sticks approach..."[29] (p.63) A basic problem with all the witness accounts, charge critics, is that they all came a minimum of 31 years after the events in question, and in many cases were recounted more than 40 years after the fact. Not only are memories this old of dubious reliability, say the critics, they were also subject to contamination from other accounts they may have heard.[2]\r\n\r\nFinally, the shifting claims of Jesse Marcel, whose suspicions that what he recovered in 1947 were "not of this world" sparked interest in the incident in the first place, and of Bill Brazel Jr., whose father discovered the debris on the Foster ranch, cast serious doubt on the reliability of their claims.\r\n\r\nTimothy Printy points out[30] that Marcel positively identified the material he appears with in the photos taken at Fort Worth as part of what he recovered, debris which skeptics and UFO advocates agree is debris from a balloon device.\r\n\r\n"Actually," said Marcel in The Roswell Incident, "this material may have looked like tinfoil and balsa wood, [emphasis in original text] but the resemblance ended there." And, "They took one picture of me on the floor holding up some of the less-interesting metallic debris...The stuff in that one photo was pieces of the actual stuff we found. It was not a staged photo."[20]\r\n\r\nAfter it was pointed out to him that the material he posed with was balloon train material, he changed his story to say that that material was not what he recovered.[14] Skeptics like Robert G. Todd argue that Marcel had a history of embellishment and exaggeration, such as claiming to have been a pilot and having received five Air Medals for shooting down enemy planes, claims which were found to be false, and his evolving Roswell story was another instance of this.[31]\r\n\r\nLike Marcel, Bill Brazel Jr. is guilty of embellishing his initial accounts, Printy charges.[30] Like Marcel, he initially made no mention of anything like the gouges in the ground mentioned in later accounts from others.[20] But as later accounts emerged of deep gouges from where aliens and their craft were allegedly recovered, Brazel''s accounts changed so that by the late 1980s he was saying: "This thing made quite a track down through there. It took a year or two for it to grass back over and heal up."[25]\r\n\r\n\r\n[edit] Contradictory conclusions, questionable research, Roswell as a myth\r\n\r\nCritics point out that the large variety of claimed crash flights suggest events spanning many years have been incorporated into a single event[2] (p.66) and that many authors uncritically embrace anything that suggests aliens, even when accounts contradict each other. Said Karl Pflock, a one-time advocate of an alien incident at Roswell: "[T]he case for Roswell is a classic example of the triumph of quantity over quality. The advocates of the crashed-saucer tale... simply shovel everything that seems to support their view into the box marked ''Evidence'' and say, ''See? Look at all this stuff. We must be right.'' [emphasis in original] Never mind the contradictions. Never mind the lack of independent supporting fact. Never mind the blatant absurdities."[29] (p.223)\r\n\r\nKal Korff suggests there are clear incentives for some to promote the idea of aliens at Roswell, while many researchers are not doing competent work: "[The] UFO field is comprised of people who are willing to take advantage of the gullibility of others, especially the paying public. Let''s not pull any punches here: The Roswell UFO myth has been very good business for UFO groups, publishers, for Hollywood, the town of Roswell, the media, and UFOlogy... [The] number of researchers who employ science and its disciplined methodology is appallingly small."[21] (p.248)\r\n\r\nGildenberg and others said that, when added up, there were as many as 11 reported alien recovery sites[2] and these recoveries bore only a marginal resemblance to the event as initially reported in 1947 or recounted later by the initial witnesses. Some of these new accounts could have been confused accounts of the several known recoveries of injured and dead from four military plane crashes which occurred in the vicinity from 1948-50.[32] Others could have been recoveries of test dummies, as suggested by the Air Force in their reports.\r\n\r\nCharles Ziegler argued that the Roswell story has all the hallmarks of a traditional folk narrative, a modern-day myth in the narrative sense.[28] (pp.1, 34) He identified six distinct narratives, starting with The Roswell Incident (1980) and a process of transmission via storytellers with a core story which was created from various witness accounts and was shaped and molded by those who carry on the group''s (the UFO community) tradition. Others were sought out to expand the core narrative, with those who give accounts not in line with the core beliefs repudiated or omitted by the "gatekeepers." (p.37) Others retold the narratives in new forms, and the process would repeat.\r\n\r\nWhile noting that certain beliefs of the subculture (the UFO community) remain intact (the government has conspired to withhold evidence of alien visitations from the public, aliens resemble small humanoids, etc.) certain other beliefs alter, reflecting change within the subculture and the community acting as co-author of the myth. "For example, such alteration occurred in the variants of the Roswell myth when the subplot of Barnett and the archaeologists stumbling upon the crash site on the Plains of San Agustin [near Socorro] (introduced in Version 1) underwent a three-step change: in Version 3, Barnett and the archaeologists stumble upon the crash site on the Foster Ranch; in Version 5, Barnett and the archaeologists are eliminated, but new archaeologists are introduced who stumble upon the crash site "35 miles north of Roswell"; and in Version 6, the entire subplot is eliminated." (p.39)\r\n\r\nThe near-total omission of testimony by Sheridan Cavitt, who thought the debris was little more than a weather balloon, is further evidence of myth construction as his story was at odds with the subculture narrative and therefore was omitted and repudiated by the "gatekeepers," said Ziegler. "It seems unlikely that the paucity of statements by Cavitt in these versions [Crash at Corona and the two Randle/Schmitt books] was due to his inaccessibility... Rather, it appears most of his statements were ignored... [It] seems reasonable to assume that his statements on this topic were omitted from various versions of the Roswell myth because they are ''unpleasant'' ? that is, they contravene the traditional conventions and beliefs of the UFO community." (p.45)\r\n\r\n[edit] Recent developments\r\n\r\n[edit] Pro-UFO advocates dismiss Roswell incident\r\n\r\nOne of the immediate outcomes of the Air Force reports on the Roswell UFO incident was the decision by some prominent UFO researchers to view the Roswell incident as not involving any alien craft.\r\n\r\nWhile the initial Air Force report was a chief reason for this, another was the release of secret documents from 1948 which showed that top Air Force officials did not know what the UFO objects being reported in the media were and their suspicion they might be Soviet spy vehicles.\r\n\r\nIn January 1997, Karl T. Pflock, one of the more prominent pro-UFO researchers, said ?Based on my research and that of others, I''m as certain as it''s possible to be without absolute proof that no flying saucer or saucers crashed in the general vicinity of Roswell or on the Plains of San Agustin in 1947. The debris found by Mac Brazel...was the remains of something very earthly, all but certainly something from the Top Secret Project Mogul....The formerly highly classified record of correspondence and discussions among top Air Force officials who were responsible for cracking the flying saucer mystery from the mid-1940s through the early 1950s makes it crystal clear that they didn''t have any crashed saucer wreckage or bodies of saucer crews, but they were desperate to have such evidence..."[33]\r\n\r\nKent Jeffrey, who organized petitions to ask President Bill Clinton to issue an Executive Order to declassify any government information on the Roswell incident, similarly concluded that no aliens were likely involved.[34][35]\r\n\r\nAnother prominent author, William L. Moore, said this in 1997: "After deep and careful consideration of recent developments concerning Roswell...I am no longer of the opinion that the extraterrestrial explanation is the best explanation for this event." Moore was co-author of the first book on Roswell, The Roswell Incident.[36]\r\n\r\n[edit] Shoddy research revealed; witnesses suspected of hoaxes\r\n\r\nAround the same time, a serious rift between two prominent Roswell authors emerged. Kevin D. Randle and Donald R. Schmitt had co-authored several books on the subject and were generally acknowledged, along with Stanton Friedman, as the leading researchers into the Roswell incident.[37] The Air Force reports on the incident suggested that basic research claimed to have been carried out was not carried out,[38] a fact verified in a 1995 Omni magazine article.[39] Additionally, Schmitt claimed he had a bachelor?s degree, a master?s degree and was in the midst of pursuing a doctorate in criminology. He also claimed to be a medical illustrator. When checked, it was revealed he was in fact a letter carrier in Hartford, Wisconsin, and had no known academic credentials. At the same time, Randle publicly distanced himself from Schmitt and his research. Referring to Schmitt?s investigation of witness Dennis?s accounts of a missing nurse at the Roswell base, he said: "The search for the nurses proves that he [Schmitt] will lie about anything. He will lie to anyone... He has revealed himself as a pathological liar... I will have nothing more to do with him."[37]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, several prominent witnesses were shown to be perpetrating hoaxes, or suspected of doing so. Frank Kaufmann, a major source of alien reports in the 1994 Randle and Schmitt book ?The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell? and a witness whose testimony it was charged was ?ignored? by the Air Force when compiling their reports,[40] was shown, after his 2001 death, to have been forging documents and inflating his role at Roswell. Randle and Mark Rodeigher repudiated Kaufmann?s credibility in two 2002 articles.[41]\r\n\r\nGlenn Dennis, who testified that Roswell alien autopsies were carried out at the Roswell base and that he and others were the subjects of threats, was deemed one of the ?least credible? Roswell witnesses by Randle in 1998. In Randle and Schmitt?s 1991 book ?UFO Crash at Roswell,? Dennis?s story was featured prominently. Randle said Dennis was not credible ?for changing the name of the nurse once we had proved she didn''t exist.?[42] Dennis?s accounts were also doubted by researcher Pflock.[33]\r\n\r\n[edit] Photo analysis; documentaries; new claims\r\n\r\nUFO researcher David Rudiak, and others before him, claimed that a Telegram which appears in one of the 1947 photos of balloon debris in Ramey''s office contains text that confirms that bodies and a "disc" were recovered. Rudiak and some other examiners claim that when enlarged, the text on the paper General Ramey is holding in his hand includes key phrases "the victims of the wreck" and "in/on the ''disc''" plus other phrases seemingly in the context of a crashed vehicle recovery.[43] However, pro-UFO interpretations of this document are disputed by independent photoanalyses (facilitated by researcher James Houran, Ph.D.) that show the letters and words are indistinct.[44]\r\nGen. Roger Ramey (kneeling) and chief of staff Col. Thomas Dubose posed with weather balloon and radar reflector, July 8, 1947, Fort Worth, Texas. Some claim text contained on the paper in Ramey''s hand (boxed) confirms an alien recovery. See enlargement below.\r\nEnlargement of Gen. Ramey''s held message in above photo.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, the Sci-Fi Channel sponsored a dig at the Brazel site in the hopes of uncovering any missed debris that the military failed to collect. Although these results have so far turned out to be negative, the University of New Mexico archaeological team did verify recent soil disruption at the exact location that some witnesses said they saw a long, linear impact groove. Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, who headed the United States Department of Energy under President Clinton, apparently found the results provocative. In 2004, he wrote in a foreword to The Roswell Dig Diaries, that "the mystery surrounding this crash has never been adequately explained?not by independent investigators, and not by the U.S. government."\r\n\r\nOn October 26, 2007, Richardson (at the time a candidate for the Democratic Party nomination for U.S. President) elaborated when he was asked about releasing government files on Roswell. Richardson responded that when he was a Congressman, he attempted to get information on behalf of his New Mexico constituents, but was told by both the Department of Defense and Los Alamos Labs that the information was classified. "That ticked me off," he said "The government doesn''t tell the truth as much as it should on a lot of issues." He promised to work on opening the files if he were elected as President.[45][46][47]\r\n\r\nIn October 2002 before airing its Roswell documentary, the Sci Fi Channel also hosted a Washington UFO news conference. John Podesta, President Clinton''s chief of staff, appeared as a member of the public relations firm hired by Sci-Fi to help get the government to open up documents on the subject. Podesta stated, "It is time for the government to declassify records that are more than 25 years old and to provide scientists with data that will assist in determining the true nature of the phenomena."[48][49]\r\n\r\nIn February 2005, the ABC TV network aired a UFO special hosted by news anchor Peter Jennings. Jennings lambasted the Roswell case as a "myth ... without a shred of evidence." ABC endorsed the Air Force''s explanation that the incident resulted solely from the crash of a Project Mogul balloon.\r\n\r\n[edit] Project Serpo\r\n\r\n    Main article: Project Serpo\r\n\r\nIn November 2005 an anonymous source claiming to be part of a high level group of people within the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the U.S., began making postings to internet UFO interest groups supposedly containing information concerning a Project Serpo. This released information allegedly confirms that in July 1947 there were two extraterrestrial UFOs that crashed in the state of New Mexico, referenced in this article as the Roswell UFO incident. The Project Serpo releases further allege that there was one surviving alien entity. Communication was allegedly established with this alien and its home world. The alien lived for 5 years and died in 1952. Communications continued with the home world, allegedly in the Zeta Reticuli star system, which led to the arrangement of an exchange program between 1965 and 1978. The only evidence in support of these fantastic claims consists of a few postings on the internet.\r\n\r\n[edit] Top Secret/Majic (2005, with new afterword)\r\n\r\nStanton T. Friedman continues to defend his view that the Majestic 12 documents which describe a secret government agency hiding information on recovered aliens are authentic. In an afterword dated April 2005 to a new edition of his book Top Secret / Majic (first published in 1996), he responds to more recent questions on their validity and concludes "I am still convinced Roswell really happened, [and] that the Eisenhower Briefing Document [i.e., Majestic 12] ...[and others] are the most important classified documents ever leaked to the public."[50]\r\n\r\nWhile the bulk of the book discusses the documents in detail, mention is made of the Barnett alien site, near Socorro,[50] (p.43) and Friedman has self-published as recently as 2003 articles which defend his view that aliens were recovered there and at a second site at the Foster ranch, seemingly the same sites as detailed in Crash at Corona.[51]\r\n\r\n[edit] Witness to Roswell (2007)\r\n\r\nIn June 2007, Donald Schmitt and his investigation partner Tom Carey published their first major joint work, Witness to Roswell.[52] In this book, they claim a "continuously growing roster of more than 600 people directly or indirectly associated with the events at Roswell who support the first account - that initial claim of the flying saucer recovery."[52] (p.38)\r\n\r\nA new date is suggested for a crash of a mysterious object - the evening of Thursday, July 3, 1947.[52] (pp.21, 127) Also unlike previous accounts, Brazel would have taken debris to Corona, where he showed fragments to local residents in the local bar, hardware store and elsewhere, and in Capitan to the south, while portions of the object ended up at 4 July rodeo.[52](pp.48-9) Numerous people are described as visiting the debris field and taking souvenirs before Brazel finally went to Roswell to report the find on July 6. Once the military was alerted to the debris, extensive efforts were undertaken to retrieve those souvenirs: "Ranch houses were and [sic] ransacked. The wooden floors of livestock sheds were pried loose plank by plank and underground cold storage fruit cellars were emptied of all their contents."[52] (p.51)\r\n\r\nThe subsequent events are related following the sequence of previous descriptions, except by suggesting a second recovery site of an alien body at the Foster ranch. This location near the debris field is the same site mentioned in 1991''s UFO Crash at Roswell. The authors suggest that Brazel''s discovery of the second site some days after finding the debris field, finally prompted him to rush to Roswell and report to the authorities.\r\n\r\nNeither Barnett nor the archaeologists are present at this body site. While noting the earlier "major problems" with Barnett''s account which caused Schmitt and previous partner Randle to omit Barnett''s claim in 1994''s The Truth about the UFO Crash at Roswell, the new book further notes another site mentioned in the 1994 publication. This site closer to Roswell "turned out to be bogus, as it was based upon the testimony of a single, alleged eyewitness [Frank Kaufmann] who himself was later discovered to have been a purveyor of false information."[52] (pp.126-7) Jim Ragsdale, whose alien account opened that book and who was claimed to have been present along with some archaeologists, is not mentioned the new book.\r\n\r\nThe book claims, for the first time, that Major Marcel saw alien bodies. Two witnesses are cited who claim that Marcel briefly mentioned seeing bodies, one a relative and another a tech sergeant who worked with Marcel''s intelligence team.[52] (pp.79-80)\r\n\r\nMuch additional new testimony is presented to support notions that alien bodies were found at the Foster ranch and at another main crash site along with a craft, then processed at the base in a hangar and at the hospital, and finally flown out in containers, all under very tight security. The book suggests Brazel found "two or three alien bodies" about two miles east of the debris field and describes the rest of a stricken alien craft along with the remainder of the crew remaining airborne for some 30 more miles before crashing at another site about 40 miles north/northwest of Roswell (but not the same site described by Kaufmann). The authors claim to have located this final crash site in 2005 where "an additional two or three dead aliens and one live one were discovered by civilian archaeologists," but offer no more information about the new site.[52] (pp.127-128)\r\n\r\nWalter Haut, as the Roswell Army Air Field public affairs officer, had drafted the initial press release that went out over the news wires on the afternoon of July 8, 1947, announcing a "flying disc." This was the only direct involvement Haut had previously admitted to in public statements and signed affidavits. The book presents a new affidavit that Haut signed in 2002 in which he claims much greater personal knowledge and involvement, including seeing alien corpses and craft, and involvement in a cover-up. Haut died in 2005.[52] (pp.215-7)\r\n\r\nAnother new first-hand account from MP Elias Benjamin describes how he guarded aliens on gurneys taken to the Roswell base hospital from the same hangar.[52] (p-136-140) Similarly, family members of Miriam Bush, secretary to the chief medical officer at Roswell base, told of having been led into an examination room where alien corpses were laid out on gurneys.[52] (Ch.12) In both accounts, one of the aliens was said to be still alive. The book also recounted earlier testimony of the Anaya family about picking up New Mexico Lt. Governor Joseph Montoya at the base, and a badly shaken Montoya relating that he saw four alien bodies at the base hangar, one of them alive.[52] (Ch.8) The Benjamin and Bush accounts, as do a few lesser ones, again place aliens at the Roswell base hospital, as had the Glenn Dennis story from almost 20 years before. The book notes that Dennis had been found to have told lies, and therefore is a supplier of unreliable testimony, but had nevertheless told others of incidents at the Roswell base long before it became associated with aliens in the late ''70s.[52] (p.135)\r\n\r\n[edit] Walter Haut controversy\r\n\r\nThe publishing of the Walter Haut affidavit[53][54] in Witness to Roswell, wherein Haut described a cover-up and seeing alien corpses, ignited a controversy in UFO circles.[55] While many embraced his accounts as confirmation of the presence of aliens from a person who was known to have been on the base in 1947, others raised questions about the believability of the accounts.\r\n\r\nUFO researcher Dennis G. Balthaser, who along with fellow researcher Wendy Connors interviewed Haut on-camera in 2000, doubted that the same man he interviewed could have written the affidavit he signed. "[The 2000 video] shows a man that couldn''t remember where he took basic training, names, dates, etc., while the 2002 affidavit is very detailed and precise with information Haut could accurately remember 2 years after he was video taped."[56] Witness to Roswell co-author Don Schmitt, he notes, admitted that the affidavit was not written by Haut, but prepared for him to sign, based on statements Haut had made privately to Schmitt and co-author Tom Carey over a period of years.[57] And further, notes Balthaser, neither he nor Carey were there when Haut signed the affidavit and the witness'' name has not been revealed, casting doubt on the circumstances of the signing.\r\n\r\nHe had further questions about what he saw as problems with the 2002 account. If the cover-up was decided at a meeting at Roswell, he asked, "why was it necessary for Major Marcel to fly debris from Roswell to General Ramey?s office in Ft Worth, since they had all handled the debris in the meeting and apparently set up the cover-up operation?" He also wondered which Haut statements were true, a 1993 affidavit he signed, the 2000 video interview, or the 2002 affidavit.\r\n\r\nBill Birnes, writing for UFO Magazine, summarizes that whatever disagreements there are about the 2000 video and the 2002 affidavit, "I think Walter Haut''s 2002 affidavit really says it all and agrees, on its material facts, with Walter''s 2000 interview with Dennis Balthaser and Wendy Connors. Dennis said he agrees with me, too, on this point."[58]\r\n\r\nA comparison of the affidavit and interview shows that in both Haut admitted to seeing a craft and at least one body in a base hangar and also attending the Roswell staff meeting where General Ramey was present and where Ramey first put the cover-up into place.[59]\r\n\r\nBirnes also says that Carey told that while Haut may not have written the affidavit, "his statements were typed, shown to him for his review and agreement, and then affirmed by him in the presence of a witness... The fact that a notary was present and sealed the document should end any doubt as to the reality of its existence."[60]\r\n\r\n[edit] Cultural influence\r\n\r\nThe Roswell incident has become a popular subject of science fiction movies, television series, video games, and books. Kevin D. Randle and Donald R. Schmitt''s 1991 nonfiction book UFO Crash at Roswell inspired the 1994 American television film Roswell, which starred Martin Sheen and Kyle McLachlan. The film received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television, but did not win.[61]\r\n\r\n[edit] Film\r\n\r\nProminent films involving Roswell include Roswell (film) starring Kyle MacLachlan and Martin Sheen - Major Jesse Marcel wants to discover the truth about strange debris found on a local rancher''s field in Roswell in July of 1947, Independence Day starring Will Smith and Bill Pullman- where the crashed alien ship is revealed to have been an advance scout for an alien invasion, only for the humans to use the ship to turn the tables on the attackers-, and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull starring Harrison Ford- where it is mentioned that Indiana Jones was one of the experts called in to study the crash in the aftermath, with the corpse being stolen a decade later. It is speculated that the Roswell aliens are related to the interdimensional beings responsible for the creation of the city known as ''El Dorado''.\r\n\r\n[edit] Celebrations\r\n\r\nEach year, during July 4 Weekend, the City of Roswell hosts the Roswell UFO Festival celebrating all things UFO along with a featuring prominent UFOlogists and discussions.\r\n\r\n[edit] Literature\r\n\r\nSeveral novels have been written about the Roswell incident, including Whitley Strieber''s Majestic (1989), Kevin D. Randle''s Operation Roswell (2004), and Sonny Whitelaw''s "Stargate SG-1: Roswell" (2007).\r\n\r\nThe Roswell aliens and debris played an important role in Mario Acevedo''s pulp science fiction and fantasy novel "The Nymphos of Rocky Flats" in which a retired soldier turned into a vampire is pinned against vampire hunters and an extraterrestrial pursuing mysterious pieces of alien technology.\r\n\r\n[edit] Television\r\n\r\nAn American television series called Roswell aired from 1999 to 2002, originally on The WB Television Network and later on UPN. Based on Melinda Metz''s Roswell High children''s book series, the program followed the lives of four extraterrestrials who had survived the Roswell crash and assumed the form of human teenagers.\r\n\r\nThe series Seven Days was based around a US time machine reverse engineered from technology recovered at Roswell. Several episodes dealt explicitly with the greys being contained within the base. Much of the show''s backstory was drawn directly from the popular theories about the Roswell incident.\r\n\r\nThe animated series Futurama also featured the Roswell UFO incident prominently in the Emmy-award winning episode "Roswell That Ends Well", where the Planet Express crew end up in 1947, resulting in an accidentally-smashed apart Bender being mistaken for the UFO, and reassembled into a flying saucer-like shape, while an alien autopsy, similar to that of the fraudulent Roswell alien autopsies film of 1995, is carried out on Doctor Zoidberg.[62]\r\n\r\nOther series in which the Roswell aliens were, in fact, regular characters of the show include Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993-1999)- where the character of Quark accidentally time travels back to that period-, American Dad! (2005-present), and Tripping the Rift (2004-present).\r\n\r\nThe Roswell incident also played prominent roles in the American science fiction television programs Dark Skies (1996-1997), The X-Files (1993-2002), Taken (2002), and Stargate SG-1 (1997-2007) (The alien race known as the Asgard are revealed to physically resemble the Roswell Greys, and it is implied that they have visited Earth before, with the actual Roswell incident being explored in the novel "Stargate SG-1: Roswell").\r\n\r\nIn the British Sci-fi television series Doctor Who, the episode "Dalek" featured a museum of alien artifacts, which included the mileometer of the Roswell ship; the museum''s owner also revealed that broadband was developed from technology found at the Roswell crash site.\r\n\r\nIn the Canadian/American TV series Tracker (2001-02), the episode "Roswell" (also known as "Area 51") the character Cole travels to Roswell to retrieve an artifact also being sought by another alien. The ship involved in the crash was said to be a Vardian treasure hunters'' ship that can be assumed to have come seeking the alien weapon hidden on Earth. The episode, however, seems to actually combine elements of Roswell, NM and the Area 51 military base.\r\n\r\nThe Disney animated children''s series Buzz Lightyear of Star Command features an episode where Team Lightyear crash lands on a planet called Roswell inhabited by Roswell aliens in a reverse-play on the 1947 incident.\r\n\r\n[edit] Comics, series and animation\r\n\r\nThe comic book series The Invisibles (1994-2000), by Grant Morrison, made extensive use of the Roswell incident in its second volume. A humorous Bongo Comics series, called Roswell, Little Green Man, ran from 1996 to 1999 and followed the misadventures of an extraterrestrial who survived from the craft. The graphic novel Roswell, Texas features an alternate history in which the site of the UFO crash was part of the still-independent republic of Texas.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese animation series Serial Experiments Lain contains an episode invoking the Roswell Incident. A syndicated children''s cartoon, called Roswell Conspiracies: Aliens, Myths and Legends (1999-2000), was distributed in several countries by the Bohbot Kids Network and inspired a 2001 PlayStation video game of the same title.\r\n\r\nIn Superman: Red Son, the alien that crashed at Roswell was established to be Abin Sur, the original Green Lantern.\r\n\r\nOne episode from the second season of the science fiction series Stargate SG-1 contains an episode which reveal to the viewers that an important alien race once visited Earth, and crashed in Roswell, and that they have studied the human race for a long period of time, learning that humans have great potential of becoming an advanced universal race.\r\n\r\n[edit] Music\r\n\r\nIn music, the Swedish death metal band Hypocrisy wrote a song called "Roswell 47", the American band Foo Fighters named their record label Roswell Records and performed a 2005 concert on the site of the Roswell Air Force Base.[63] In addition, an ambient music compilation CD called Area 51: The Roswell Incident was released in 1997 and featured such groups as Canada''s Syn?sthesia, England''s Hawkwind, and Germany''s Tangerine Dream. (Area 51 refers to an air field in southern Nevada associated with other UFO conspiracy theories.) Heavy Metal Band Megadeth based Hangar 18, and its subsequent video, on the incident. They also made another called "Return to Hangar" which is believed to have something to do with the incident. Pitchshifter (band) also based a song entitled "Hangar 84" on the Roswell incident.\r\n\r\nThe band Far-Less features a song on their album "Everyone is Out to Get Us" called "Roswell that Ends Well", a song about alien activity, and other-worldy forces. Will Smith once mocked Roswell in the song Men In Black when he said: "So go witcha life, forget that Roswell crap" A song by the band the Pixies titled "Motorway to Roswell" from the album "Trompe Le Monde" offers an interpretation of the incident.\r\n\r\nAmerican rock band the Foo Fighters performed a show in the Roswell Industrial Air Center at the site of the crash. Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl is known for having an interest in supernatural phenomena, even naming the band after an old term for UFO, and named his record company (Roswell) after the famous incident.\r\n\r\nThe American band Splitsville pays tribute to this incident in their song "Home" (from the album Ultrasound). The lyrics are sung from the point of view of the alien, who discovers that he needs to put his ship down because he''s running out of fuel. He states that, "I could do worse than a southwestern American town. I might as well...land in Roswell". As he begins his descent into Roswell, the alien ponders his potential fate, stating that, "I''ve been alone up here for so so long...a few new faces just might do me good".\r\n\r\nNorwegian punkrockers The Skitzophones recorded the song Remember 47 in 2007. It?s a story about surviving aliens from the crash who disappeared in 47 and are now coming back to earth to start a punk rock band.\r\n\r\n[edit] Video Games\r\n\r\nIn the skating video game Tony Hawk''s Pro Skater, there is a level called Roswell. If the player explores enough, an alien and a UFO may be seen. Also in the video game Destroy All Humans, the player travels to Area 42, a base near Roswell to release a captured alien comrade. Recently, in the Hoyle Puzzles and Board Games of 2008, a feature was incorporated wherein the player was allowed to play against a green alien with black eyes, and a humorous personality, who goes by the name of Roswell.There is also a gaming laptop company that goes by the name of Alienware. It features laptops named Area-51s. In the online role playing game, World of Warcraft, there exists a town by the name of Area 52. In the first Carmageddon game there is a level named "Roswell that Ends Well"\r\n\r\n[edit] See also\r\n\r\n    * Alien autopsy\r\n    * List of major UFO sightings\r\n    * National Security Act of 1947\r\n\r\n[edit] References\r\n\r\n   1. ^ "Results of a Search for Records Concerning the 1947 Crash Near Roswell, New Mexico (Letter Report, 07/28/95, GAO/NSIAD-95-187)".

The issue of an exact date is not a problem for those who suggest a Project Mogul device was the source of the debris as the most frequently cited balloon train source of the debris flew in early June, so any debris found afterwards could be accounted for.\r\n   9. ^ a b , .

INSERT INTO `wiki` VALUES (45, 'BitTorrent protocol encryption', 'BitTorrent protocol encryption\r\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\r\nJump to: navigation, search\r\n\r\nProtocol encryption (PE), Message stream encryption (MSE), or Protocol header encrypt (PHE)[1] are related features of some peer-to-peer file-sharing clients, including BitTorrent clients. They attempt to make traffic harder to identify by third parties including internet service providers (ISPs).\r\n\r\nMSE/PE is implemented in aria2, BitComet, BitTornado, Deluge, Flashget, Halite Client, KTorrent, Mainline, rTorrent, ?Torrent, Transmission, and Vuze. PHE was implemented in old versions of BitComet. Similar protocol obfuscation is supported in up-to-date versions of some other (non-BitTorrent) systems including eMule.\r\nContents\r\n[hide]\r\n\r\n    * 1 Purpose\r\n    * 2 History\r\n          o 2.1 Early approach\r\n          o 2.2 Development of MSE/PE\r\n          o 2.3 MSE/PE in BitTorrent client versions\r\n    * 3 Operation\r\n    * 4 Security\r\n    * 5 Effectiveness\r\n          o 5.1 Remains vulnerable to disrupted peer traffic\r\n    * 6 Criticism\r\n    * 7 Notes and references\r\n    * 8 External links\r\n\r\n[edit] Purpose\r\n\r\nPeer-to-peer file-sharing traffic makes up more than a third of total internet traffic. Some ISPs deal with this traffic by increasing their capacity whilst others use specialised systems to throttle (i.e. slow down) BitTorrent traffic. Obfuscation and encryption make traffic harder to detect and therefore harder to throttle. These systems are not designed to provide anonymity or confidentiality.\r\n\r\n[edit] History\r\n\r\n[edit] Early approach\r\n\r\nProtocol header encryption (PHE) was conceived by RnySmile and first implemented in BitComet version 0.60 on 8 September 2005. Some software like IPP2P claims BitComet traffic is detectable even with PHE. PHE is detectable because only part of the stream is encrypted. Since there are no open specifications to this protocol implementation the only possibility to support it in other clients would have been via reverse engineering.\r\n\r\n[edit] Development of MSE/PE\r\n\r\nIn late January 2006 the developers of Azureus, now known as Vuze, decided to design and simultaneously implement a new, open protocol obfuscation method, called message stream encryption (MSE). It was included in Azureus CVS snapshot 2307-B29 on 19 January 2006.\r\n\r\nThis first draft was heavily criticized since it lacked several key features. After negotiations between different BitTorrent developers a new proposal was written and then implemented into the Azureus and ?Torrent betas within days. The developers were ludde, uau, The 8472, Parg and Nolar. In ?Torrent, the new protocol was called protocol encryption (PE).\r\n\r\n[edit] MSE/PE in BitTorrent client versions\r\n\r\nAzureus supports the final spec since 25 January 2006 (CVS snapshot 2307-B33). Azureus version 2.4.0.0 was released 10 February 2006, and was the first stable version of a client to support MSE/PE. However, glitches in Azureus'' implementation resulted in improperly encrypted pieces that failed hash checking. The glitches were rectified as of version 2.4.0.2.\r\n\r\n?Torrent premiered MSE/PE 4 days after Azureus with beta 1.4.1 build 407. ?Torrent version 1.5 (build 436) was released on 7 March 2006; it was the first stable version of ?Torrent with PE.\r\n\r\nBitComet version 0.63 was released 7 March 2006. It removed the old protocol header encryption and implemented the new MSE/PE to be compatible with Azureus and ?Torrent.\r\n\r\nKTorrent implemented MSE/PE in SVN version 535386 on April 29, 2006.\r\n\r\nMainline supports MSE/PE since version 4.9.2-beta on May 2, 2006.\r\n\r\nBitTornado supports MSE/PE as of build T-0.3.18. As of January 5, 2007, this build is still marked "experimental" on the Download page.\r\n\r\nrTorrent supports MSE/PE as of rTorrent-0.7.0.\r\n\r\nDeluge supports MSE/PE as of Deluge-0.5.1.\r\n\r\nTransmission supports MSE/PE as of Transmission-0.90.\r\n\r\naria2 supports MSE/PE as of aria2-0.13.0.\r\n\r\n[edit] Operation\r\n\r\nThe BitComet PHE method used in versions 0.60 to 0.62 is neither published, nor is it compatible with MSE/PE.\r\n\r\nMSE/PE uses key exchange combined with the infohash of the torrent to establish an RC4 encryption key. The key exchange helps to minimize the risk of passive listeners, and the infohash helps avoid man-in-the-middle attacks. RC4 is chosen for its speed. The first kilobyte of the RC4 output is discarded to prevent a particular attack.\r\n\r\nThe specification allows the users to choose between encrypting the headers only or the full connection. Encrypting the full connection provides more obfuscation but uses more CPU time.\r\n\r\nTo ensure compatibility with other clients that don''t support this specification, users may also choose whether unencrypted incoming or outgoing connections are still allowed.\r\n\r\nSupported clients propagate the fact that they have MSE/PE enabled through PEX and DHT.\r\n\r\n[edit] Security\r\n\r\nThe estimated strength of the encryption corresponds to about 60?80 bits for common symmetrical ciphers[16]. This is quite low for today''s standards but one has to keep in mind that this protocol wasn''t designed as a secure transport protocol but as a fast and efficient obfuscation method. AES was proposed as the encryption method but not adopted because it consumed too much CPU time and the required D-H keys to achieve a security equal to AES would have been much bigger or require elliptic curve cryptography, making the handshake more expensive in terms of used CPU time.\r\n\r\n[edit] Effectiveness\r\n\r\nSome ISPs are now using more sophisticated measures (e.g. pattern/timing analysis or categorizing ports based on side-channel data) to detect BitTorrent traffic. This means that even encrypted BitTorrent traffic can be throttled. However, with ISPs that continue to use simpler, less costly methods to identify and throttle BitTorrent, the current solution remains extremely effective.\r\n\r\n[edit] Remains vulnerable to disrupted peer traffic\r\n\r\nThe Sandvine application uses a different approach to disrupt BitTorrent traffic that makes seeding impossible. The Sandvine application intercepts peer-to-tracker communication to identify peers based on the IP address and port numbers in the peer list returned from the tracker. When Sandvine later sees connections to peers in the intercepted peer lists, it may (according to policy) break these connections by sending counterfeit TCP resets. Various solutions exist to protect against Sandvine''s attack including encrypting both peer-to-tracker and peer-to-peer communication, using Microsoft''s Teredo so that TCP connections are tunneled within UDP packets, filtering TCP resets before they reach the TCP layer in the end-host, or switching entirely from a TCP-based transport to a UDP-based transport. Each solution has its trade-offs. Filtering out TCP resets typically requires kernel access, and the participation of the remote peer since Sandvine sent the reset packet to the local and remote peers. Teredo is not available on all BitTorrent clients. Rewriting TCP reliability, in-order delivery and congestion control in a new UDP protocol represents a substantial engineering effort and would require upgrading both ends of any peer-to-peer connection. Increasing robustness to TCP resets solves Sandvine''s attack, but it does not prevent internet applications from using the peer lists to perform other attacks such as blocking peer-to-peer connections completely. Encryption also won''t stop a traffic shaping system configured to universally slow down all encrypted, unidentifiable or unknown protocols using a method as simple as packet loss. Encrypting tracker communications prevents eavesdropping on peer lists and does not require upgrading both ends of peer-to-peer connections, but it requires imposing computational overhead on the tracker.\r\n\r\n[edit] Criticism\r\n\r\nBram Cohen, the inventor of BitTorrent, opposed adding encryption to the BitTorrent protocol. Cohen stated he was worried that encryption could create incompatibility between clients. He also stressed the point that the majority of ISPs don''t block the torrent protocol. Cohen wrote "I rather suspect that some developer has gotten rate limited by his ISP, and is more interested in trying to hack around his ISP''s limitations than in the performance of the internet as a whole". Many BitTorrent community users responded strongly against Cohen''s accusations.Cohen later added the ability to receive but not originate encrypted connections on his Mainline client. Notably, when ?Torrent was purchased by BitTorrent, Inc. and then became the next mainline release, the ability to originate encrypted connections was not removed.\r\n\r\n[edit] Notes and references\r\n\r\n   1. ^ It is usually referred to as the more correct protocol header encryption instead.\r\n   2. ^ "Wired: The Bittorrent Effect" (2007-05-30).\r\n   3. ^ "IPP2P homepage - News" (2006-01-04).\r\n   4. ^ "CVS Snapshot Azureus2307-B29.jar has been released !"

Version 0.1 was first publicly released on October 31, 1992. Version 1.0 followed in February 1993.\r\n\r\nOpenBSD''s version of gzip is actually the compress program, to which support for the gzip format was added in OpenBSD 3.4 - the ''g'' in this specific version stands for gratis.[1]\r\nContents\r\n[hide]\r\n\r\n    * 1 File format\r\n    * 2 Other uses\r\n    * 3 References\r\n    * 4 See also\r\n    * 5 External links\r\n\r\n[edit] File format\r\ngzip Filename extension 	.gz\r\nInternet media type 	application/x-gzip\r\nDeveloped by 	Jean-Loup Gailly and Mark Adler\r\nType of format 	data compression\r\n\r\ngzip is based on the DEFLATE algorithm, which is a combination of LZ77 and Huffman coding. DEFLATE was intended as a replacement for LZW and other patent-encumbered data compression algorithms which, at the time, limited the usability of compress and other popular archivers.\r\n\r\n?gzip? is often also used to refer to the gzip file format, which is:\r\n\r\n    * a 10-byte header, containing a magic number, a version number and a timestamp\r\n    * optional extra headers, such as the original file name,\r\n    * a body, containing a DEFLATE-compressed payload\r\n    * an 8-byte footer, containing a CRC-32 checksum and the length of the original uncompressed data\r\n\r\nAlthough its file format also allows for multiple such streams to be concatenated (zipped files are simply decompressed concatenated as if they were originally one file), gzip is normally used to compress just single files. Compressed archives are typically created by assembling collections of files into a single tar archive, and then compressing that archive with gzip. The final .tar.gz or .tgz file is usually called a tarball.\r\n\r\ngzip is not to be confused with the ZIP archive format, which also uses DEFLATE. The ZIP format can hold collections of files without an external archiver, but is less compact than compressed tarballs holding the same data, because it compresses files individually and cannot take advantage of redundancy between files (solid compression).\r\n\r\nzlib is an abstraction of the DEFLATE algorithm in library form which includes support both for the gzip file format and a lightweight stream format in its API. The zlib stream format, DEFLATE, and the gzip file format were standardized respectively as RFC 1950, RFC 1951, and RFC 1952.\r\n\r\nThe corresponding program for uncompressing gzipped files is gunzip. Both commands call the same binary; gunzip has the same effect as gzip -d.\r\n\r\nOther uses\r\n\r\nThe ?Content-Encoding? header in HTTP/1.1 allows clients to optionally receive compressed HTTP responses and (less commonly) to send compressed requests. The standard itself specifies two compression methods: ?gzip? (RFC 1952; the content wrapped in a gzip stream) and ?deflate? (RFC 1950; the content wrapped in a zlib-formatted stream). Compressed responses are supported by many HTTP client libraries, almost all modern browsers and both of the major HTTP server platforms, Apache and Microsoft IIS. Many server implementations, however, incorrectly implement the protocol by using the raw DEFLATE stream format (RFC 1951) instead. The bug is sufficiently pervasive that most modern browsers will accept both RFC 1951 and RFC 1950-formatted data for the ?deflate? compressed method.\r\n\r\nSince the late 1990s, bzip2, a file compression utility based on a block-sorting algorithm, has gained some popularity as a gzip replacement. It produces considerably smaller files (especially for source code and other structured text), but at the cost of memory and processing time (up to a factor of 4). bzip2-compressed tarballs are conventionally named either .tar.bz2 or simply .tbz.\r\n\r\nAdvanceCOMP and 7-Zip can produce gzip-compatible files, using an internal DEFLATE implementation with better compression ratios than gzip itself?at the cost of more processor time compared to the reference implementation.\r\n\r\n[edit] References\r\n\r\n    * RFC 1952 - GZIP file format specification version 4.3\r\n\r\n   1. ^ "OpenBSD gzip(1) manual page".

The term character set refers only to the set (or group) of characters (and sometimes device control codes) used by a particular encoding system, but does not include their numerical assignments nor order therein. The term character encoding includes a character set and how each character is represented within a character encoding system.\r\n\r\nFor historical reasons, MIME and systems based on it use the abbreviation charset to refer to the complete system for encoding a sequence of characters into a sequence of octets.\r\n\r\n[edit] History\r\n\r\nCommon examples of character encoding systems include Morse code, the Baudot code, the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) and Unicode.\r\n\r\nMorse code was introduced in the 1840s and is used to encode each letter of the Latin alphabet and each Arabic numeral as a series of long and short presses of a telegraph key. Representations of characters encoded using Morse code varied in length.\r\n\r\nThe Baudot code was created by Émile Baudot in 1870, patented in 1874, modified by Donald Murray in 1901, and standardized by CCITT as International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2) in 1930.\r\n\r\nThe American Standard Code for Information Interchange (usually abbreviated ASCII) was introduced in 1963 and is a 7-bit encoding scheme used to encode letters, numerals, symbols, and device control codes as fixed-length codes using integers). IBM''s Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code (usually abbreviated EBCDIC) is an 8-bit encoding scheme developed in 1963.\r\n\r\nThe limitations of such sets soon became apparent, and a number of ad-hoc methods were developed to extend them. The need to support more writing systems for different languages, including the CJK family of East Asian scripts, required support for a far larger number of characters and demanded a systematic approach to character encoding rather than the previous ad hoc approaches.\r\n\r\nEarly binary repertoires include:\r\n\r\n    * I Ching (China 1122 BC - 256 BC)\r\n    * Braille\r\n    * International maritime signal flags\r\n    * Chinese telegraph code (Hans Schjellerup, 1869, modified 1872 and following)\r\n\r\n          Encoding of Chinese characters as 4-digit decimals.\r\n\r\n[edit] Modern encoding model\r\n\r\nUnicode and its parallel standard, ISO 10646 Universal Character Set, which together constitute the most modern character encoding, broke away from this idea, and instead separated the ideas of what characters are available, their numbering, how those numbers are encoded as a series of "code units" (limited-size numbers), and finally how those units are encoded as a stream of octets (bytes). The idea behind this decomposition is to establish a universal set of characters that can be encoded in a variety of ways[1]. To correctly describe this model needs more precise terms than "character set" and "character encoding". The terms used in the modern model follow:\r\n\r\nA character repertoire is the full set of abstract characters that a system supports. The repertoire may be closed, that is no additions are allowed without creating a new standard (as is the case with ASCII and most of the ISO-8859 series), or it may be open, allowing additions (as is the case with Unicode and to a limited extent the Windows code pages). The characters in a given repertoire reflect decisions that have been made about how to divide writing systems into linear information units. The basic variants of the Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic alphabets, can be broken down into letters, digits, punctuation, and a few special characters like the space, which can all be arranged in simple linear sequences that are displayed in the same order they are read. Even with these alphabets however diacritics pose a complication: they can be regarded either as part of a single character containing a letter and diacritic (known in modern terminology as a precomposed character), or as separate characters. The former allows a far simpler text handling system but the latter allows any letter/diacritic combination to be used in text. Other writing systems, such as Arabic and Hebrew, are represented with more complex character repertoires due to the need to accommodate things like bidirectional text and glyphs that are joined together in different ways for different situations.\r\n\r\nA coded character set specifies how to represent a repertoire of characters using a number of non-negative integer codes called code points. For example, in a given repertoire, a character representing the capital letter "A" in the Latin alphabet might be assigned to the integer 65, the character for "B" to 66, and so on. A complete set of characters and corresponding integers is a coded character set. Multiple coded character sets may share the same repertoire; for example ISO/IEC 8859-1 and IBM code pages 037 and 500 all cover the same repertoire but map them to different codes. In a coded character set, each code point only represents one character.\r\n\r\nA character encoding form (CEF) specifies the conversion of a coded character set''s integer codes into a set of limited-size integer code values that facilitate storage in a system that represents numbers in binary form using a fixed number of bits (i.e. practically any computer system). For example, a system that stores numeric information in 16-bit units would only be able to directly represent integers from 0 to 65,535 in each unit, but larger integers could be represented if more than one 16-bit unit could be used. This is what a CEF accommodates: it defines a way of mapping single code point from a range of, say, 0 to 1.4 million, to a series of one or more code values from a range of, say, 0 to 65,535.\r\n\r\nThe simplest CEF system is simply to choose large enough units that the values from the coded character set can be encoded directly (one code point to one code value). This works well for coded character sets that fit in 8 bits (as most legacy non-CJK encodings do) and reasonably well for coded character sets that fit in 16 bits (such as early versions of Unicode). However, as the size of the coded character set increases (e.g. modern Unicode requires at least 21 bits/character), this becomes less and less efficient, and it is difficult to adapt existing systems to use larger code values. Therefore, most systems working with later versions of Unicode use either UTF-8, which maps Unicode code points to variable-length sequences of octets, or UTF-16/UCS-2, which maps Unicode code points to variable-length sequences of 16-bit words.\r\n\r\nNext, a character encoding scheme (CES) specifies how the fixed-size integer codes should be mapped into an octet sequence suitable for saving on an octet-based file system or transmitting over an octet-based network. With Unicode, a simple character encoding scheme is used in most cases, simply specifying whether the bytes for each integer should be in big-endian or little-endian order (even this isn''t needed with UTF-8). However, there are also compound character encoding schemes, which use escape sequences to switch between several simple schemes (such as ISO/IEC 2022), and compressing schemes, which try to minimise the number of bytes used per code unit (such as SCSU, BOCU, and Punycode).\r\n\r\nFinally, there may be a higher level protocol which supplies additional information that can be used to select the particular variant of a Unicode character, particularly where there are regional variants that have been ''unified'' in Unicode as the same character. An example is the XML attribute xml:lang.\r\n\r\n[edit] Popular character encodings\r\n\r\n    * ISO 646\r\n          o ASCII\r\n    * EBCDIC\r\n          o CP930\r\n    * ISO 8859:\r\n          o ISO 8859-1 Western Europe\r\n          o ISO 8859-2 Western and Central Europe\r\n          o ISO 8859-3 Western Europe and South European ( Turkish, Maltese plus Esperanto )\r\n          o ISO 8859-4 Western Europe and Baltic countries ( Lithuania, Estonia and Lapp )\r\n          o ISO 8859-5 Cyrillic alphabet\r\n          o ISO 8859-6 Arabic\r\n          o ISO 8859-7 Greek\r\n          o ISO 8859-8 Hebrew\r\n          o ISO 8859-9 Western Europe with amended Turkish character set\r\n          o ISO 8859-10 Western Europe with rationalised character set for Nordic languages, including complete Icelandic set.\r\n          o ISO 8859-11 Thai\r\n          o ISO 8859-13 Baltic languages plus Polish\r\n          o ISO 8859-14 Celtic languages ( Irish Gaelic, Scottish, Welsh )\r\n          o ISO 8859-15 Added the Euro sign and other rationalisations to ISO 8859-1\r\n          o ISO 8859-16 Central European languages ( Polish, Czech, Slovenian, Slovak, Hungarian, Albanian, Romanian, German, Italian )\r\n    * CP437, CP737, CP850, CP852, CP855, CP857, CP858, CP860, CP861, CP863, CP865, CP866, CP869\r\n    * MS-Windows character sets:\r\n          o Windows-1250 for Central European languages that use Latin script, (Polish, Czech, Slovak, Hungarian, Slovene, Serbian, Croatian, Romanian and Albanian)\r\n          o Windows-1251 for Cyrillic alphabets\r\n          o Windows-1252 for Western languages\r\n          o Windows-1253 for Greek\r\n          o Windows-1254 for Turkish\r\n          o Windows-1255 for Hebrew\r\n          o Windows-1256 for Arabic\r\n          o Windows-1257 for Baltic languages\r\n          o Windows-1258 for Vietnamese\r\n    * Mac OS Roman\r\n    * KOI8-R, KOI8-U, KOI7\r\n    * MIK\r\n    * Cork or T1\r\n    * ISCII\r\n    * TSCII\r\n    * VISCII\r\n    * JIS X 0208 is a widely deployed standard for Japanese character encoding that has several encoding forms.\r\n          o Shift_JIS (Microsoft Code page 932 is a dialect of Shift_JIS)\r\n          o EUC-JP\r\n          o ISO-2022-JP\r\n    * JIS X 0213 is an extended version of JIS X 0208.\r\n          o Shift_JIS-2004\r\n          o EUC-JIS-2004\r\n          o ISO-2022-JP-2004\r\n    * Chinese Guobiao\r\n          o GB 2312\r\n          o GBK (Microsoft Code page 936)\r\n          o GB 18030\r\n    * Taiwan Big5 (a more famous variant is Microsoft Code page 950)\r\n    * Hong Kong HKSCS\r\n    * KS X 1001 is a Korean double-byte character encoding standard\r\n          o EUC-KR\r\n          o ISO-2022-KR\r\n    * Unicode (and subsets thereof, such as the 16-bit ''Basic Multilingual Plane'').
